# busy-office-ui — Roadmap

A CSS-first ERP UI framework: semantic components, density-aware tokens, modern CSS,
generated-and-verified docs. This file is the long-term plan; per-slice detail and the
design-review trail live in `.roundtable/`, and every breaking change is in
`CHANGELOG.md`.

## Done

### Slice 1 — Foundation + core components
Workspace + PostCSS/tsc tooling, `@layer` skeleton; tokens (palette / semantic /
density / dark hooks); reset + layout primitives; button, forms, badge, dense data
table, navbar + sidebar nav, dialog; opt-in `htmx.css`; Astro docs gallery.

### Slice 2 — Interaction & filtering
Tabs, dropdown (popover), alerts/toasts, filter bar + chips + saved views, pagination
+ table footer, form sections, off-canvas drawer, inline edit, dark-theme toggle.
Two design-grill gates worked (delegation rewrite, FF 128 floor, à-la-carte
restructure, contrast fixes).

### Slice 3 — ERP workflows & dashboards
Status timeline, audit trail, dashboard stat tiles + widget grid, wizard stepper,
theming guide + versioning policy, print/report layer. Grilled; container-naming
build rule enforced.

### Slice 4 — Records & approval
Byline, ordered list (mono/`--plain`/editable rows), record-type badge, small &
danger-ghost buttons, widget band footer; composed in the record-detail pattern.
Grilled and decomposed into small general components per the "one component, many
settings" principle.

### Engineering & docs discipline
- 7 build-enforced gates: named `@container`, contrast threshold **+ coverage**,
  behaviors-vs-`.d.ts`, dist link resolution, stylelint naming, 11 behavior tests,
  page-shape (every component page has its opener/`ClassRef`/demo/`ApiTable`/
  `Related`/sidebar entry — `check-page-shape.mjs`, added in Slice 5).
- Generated-from-artifact docs: API tables, contrast tables, class index, `llms.txt`,
  quick-reference cheat sheets, AA-per-component — none hand-maintained, all CI-gated
  against drift.
- CI + GitHub Pages deploy (gated on tests); Docker consumer app; Podman docs image.
- Four adversarial multi-seat design reviews, every gate finding fixed or ledgered.

### Slice 5 — Docs UX polish + ERP data-entry fields
Fixed app chrome (independent-scroll shell) + responsive nav drawer + full-width
landing; the theme-switch-flash P0; ERP Amount field; data-table column alignment
(+ a latent specificity bug fix); Cmd/Ctrl+K command palette; sidebar scroll
persistence; the opt-in Motion module (8 reduced-motion-safe animations); the
Ledger teal brand palette + SVG logo + favicon; a section-by-section docs
simplicity pass; the `new:component` scaffold generator + page-shape build gate
(gate 7); copy buttons + the `Demo` wrapper component (site-wide, satisfying the
"Docs UX cluster 2" ask — full migration of all 17 component pages onto the
`Demo` wrapper specifically is optional polish, not tracked further since
hand-authored demo sections are already gate-compliant and already copyable).
Full detail: `.roundtable/loop-log.md`.

## In progress — Slice 6: Component depth + a11y hardening

Reconciled 2026-08-14 (Roadmap loop, after the ARIA-grid Explore graduation).
Ordered by value × effort; `npm publish` is intentionally last — it's
owner-gated, not something a loop iteration can close.

**Queued (priority order)**
0. [x] **P0 — navigation flash/flicker, real root cause: whole-page reload,
       not a paint-timing issue.** Two earlier passes fixed real but
       secondary bugs (theme applied too late; no `color-scheme` hint for
       the browser's pre-paint default) without touching the actual
       mechanism. 2026-08-14 user follow-up named the real symptom
       precisely: **"kind of whole screen refresh, instead of replacing
       the main area."** That reframed it correctly — this is a static
       multi-page site, so every sidebar click was a full document
       navigation: header, sidebar, everything tore down and rebuilt on
       every click, independent of whether colors matched.
       - **Fix (confirmed with the user first — new runtime dependency +
         navigation-model change, not a CSS tweak):** `htmx` `hx-boost` on
         `<body>` (Gallery.astro), targeting/selecting `#main-content`
         (the `<main>` element) — only that swaps on an internal link
         click; header, sidebar, and scripts now persist. `htmx.org` added
         as a dependency of the **docs app** (`apps/docs/package.json`)
         only — the shipped `@busy-office/ui` package stays at its
         genuine zero runtime dependencies.
       - Had to hand-rebuild what a full reload used to give for free:
         sidebar `aria-current` (was server-rendered per page; now synced
         from `location.pathname` on every `htmx:afterSwap`), the
         right-rail TOC + copy-button injection (re-run per swap, same
         event), scroll-to-top on the main pane. Component pages' own
         inline `<script>` blocks (`initDataGrid()`, `initCollapsibleCards()`,
         etc.) needed **no changes** — they live inside the swapped
         region and htmx re-executes script tags in swapped content by
         design; document-delegated behaviors (tabs, dropdown, dialog,
         alerts) needed **no changes** either, since `document` itself is
         never touched by a partial swap.
       - Found and fixed a real regression the new model introduced: the
         mobile nav drawer and Cmd/Ctrl+K palette live *outside*
         `#main-content`, so unlike everything else they now persist
         across a swap instead of resetting — without a fix, navigating
         via a link inside the drawer left it hanging open. Both now close
         explicitly on `htmx:afterSwap`.
       - TOC hash-links (`#heading-id`) excluded from boosting
         (`hx-boost="false"` on `#toc-nav`) — same-page anchors must stay
         native scroll-to-anchor, not a navigation.
       - **Verified live**, extensively, via the bind-mounted Podman
         container: tagged the header/sidebar DOM nodes before a boosted
         click and confirmed the SAME nodes (not new ones) after — genuine
         partial swap, not a reload made to look like one. Confirmed
         title/URL/`aria-current` all update correctly. Confirmed
         `initDataTables()` and `initDataGrid()` both re-initialize
         correctly on a swapped-in data-table page (select-all works,
         `role="grid"` present). Confirmed TOC/copy-buttons repopulate.
         Confirmed a hash-link click doesn't trigger a boost. Confirmed
         dark theme survives navigation (trivially now — `<html>` is never
         touched). Confirmed `Tabs` (document-delegated) still works.
         Confirmed the drawer-close fix. Zero console errors across all of
         it. All gates green, 20 tests pass.
       - **Follow-up round (same wake, before moving to a new item):**
         click-tested the previously-flagged Pagefind gap directly instead
         of trusting the "should work" assumption — it didn't. Two real
         bugs found and fixed:
         1. `import 'htmx.org'` (ESM build) only default-exports `htmx`; it
            never sets `window.htmx`. Fixed: `import htmx from 'htmx.org';
            window.htmx = htmx;` — needed so other scripts can call
            `htmx.process()` at all.
         2. Even with that fixed, `htmx.process(container)` does NOT
            retroactively re-derive an ANCESTOR's `hx-boost` for newly-
            added descendants — that inheritance is only computed at the
            initial page-load scan (confirmed empirically by testing both
            ways, not assumed from docs). Fixed: a `MutationObserver` on
            the Pagefind results containers (`#docsearch`, `#cmdk-search`)
            sets `hx-boost="true"` explicitly on each fresh result link
            before calling `htmx.process()`.
         Re-verified after both fixes: tagged the header before a search
         + click and confirmed it persists, URL/title/sidebar
         `aria-current` all update correctly — same standard as every
         other boosted path. Also re-ran the full component-page sweep
         (Dialog, Alerts/toasts trigger+dismiss, Dropdown) after the
         earlier hx-boost commit specifically to broaden coverage beyond
         the 2 pages tested there — all confirmed working, zero console
         errors, gates green, 20 tests pass.
1. [x] **Skeleton / empty / error states** — shipped as two components (not
       three classes): `.bo-skeleton` (`--circle`/`--block` shimmer
       placeholders, `aria-busy` is the programmatic channel) and `.bo-state`
       with an `--error` modifier for empty/error — one component, two
       settings, per the standing "one component, many settings" principle,
       rather than the literal `.bo-empty-state`/`.bo-error-state` split
       first sketched. Icon *shape* differs per state, not just color. Both
       continuous-loop shimmer, guarded by an explicit reduced-motion
       override (not duration-token-driven, same reasoning as
       `.bo-motion-spin`). Docs: `/components/state-patterns` (one page, all
       three states, via a shared `PAGE_SLUG` alias — which turned out to be
       tracked in **three** separate places: `extract-api.mjs`,
       `check-page-shape.mjs`, `gen-llms.mjs`; updated all three, worth
       consolidating in a future Standardize pass). Verified live via Podman
       (`bo-docs-run`): light + dark at 1440px, and narrow-viewport reflow
       confirmed (no overflow/clipping). All 7 gates green, 11 tests pass.
2. [x] **Data-table ARIA grid pattern** — shipped as a new opt-in behavior,
       `initDataGrid()` + `data-grid-nav` (packages/core/src/js/behaviors/
       data-grid.ts), separate from `initDataTables()` so selection/sort are
       untouched for every existing consumer. Sets `role="grid"` on the
       table — `td`/`th` get their `gridcell`/`columnheader` roles
       *implicitly* from the HTML-AAM mapping once the table has that role,
       so no per-cell markup is needed. `aria-multiselectable` (when the
       table has row-select checkboxes), 1-based `aria-rowindex`/
       `aria-colindex` (supplementary — this table is never virtualized, so
       they're not load-bearing the way they are for a virtualized grid, but
       included per the accept criteria). Two-level roving tabindex per the
       APG "Data Grid" (interactive-widgets) example: one Tab stop for the
       whole grid, arrow keys move the cell cursor (clamped, no wrap, incl.
       Home/End and Ctrl+Home/Ctrl+End), Enter focuses a cell's one
       interactive descendant (checkbox/button/input), Escape hands focus
       back to the cell. `aria-selected` synced on the row from the
       checkbox's `change` event. Docs: a new "Keyboard grid navigation"
       demo section on `/components/data-table`. 5 new behavior tests (16
       total, all pass) plus live verification in a real Chromium DOM via
       Podman — role/multiselectable/rowindex, focus mechanics (ArrowRight
       moves the cursor, Enter/Escape into-and-out-of the checkbox,
       aria-selected on check) all confirmed against the actual browser, not
       just jsdom. **Not done this tick:** an actual VoiceOver verbalization
       pass — that's Slice 6 item 5 (Runtime a11y pass); this item shipped
       the correct ARIA semantics and keyboard mechanics but hasn't been
       listened to yet, so "AA outright" isn't claimed until that pass runs.
3. Slice-4 continuation:
   - [x] **Avatar byline** — `.bo-byline__avatar` (optional part): initials or an
         `<img>`, em-sized so it scales with `--compact` automatically instead of
         its own size modifier. Scoped via `:has(.bo-byline__avatar)` so a
         plain-text byline (the common case) gets zero layout change. Always
         `aria-hidden` — decoration, the name is already text in the byline.
         Verified live (Podman, light + dark).
   - [x] **Collapsible cards** — extends `.bo-widget` (not a new component):
         `.bo-widget__collapse` wraps `__body` using the same
         grid-template-rows 0fr/1fr technique as the Motion module's
         `.bo-motion-collapse` (duplicated locally — a component shouldn't
         have to import the opt-in Motion module for this; the tokens are
         core). New opt-in behavior `initCollapsibleCards()` +
         `data-collapse-trigger`: toggles the trigger's `aria-expanded` and
         the panel's `data-state`, the two-channel contract (chevron
         rotation is decoration). No `data-state` at all defaults to open —
         degrades to a plain widget without the behavior wired up. Docs: new
         "Collapsible" demo on `/components/dashboard`. 2 new tests (18
         total, pass). Verified live: light + dark, toggle confirmed via
         screenshot (chevron rotates, panel visibly collapses).
   - [x] **`.bo-composer`** — how a new `.bo-audit` entry gets *written*, not
         just read. Layout-only, composing existing primitives rather than
         inventing controls: `.bo-byline__avatar` for the "who", a plain
         `.bo-input` textarea (already styles `textarea.bo-input`), an
         actions row. Lives in `approval-workflow.css` next to
         `.bo-timeline`/`.bo-audit` (the thematic file, not a new component
         dir). Docs: new demo section on `/components/approval-workflow`,
         inserted sample-before-code per the ordering audit two ticks ago.
         Verified live: typed into the textarea, confirmed it persists
         through a theme switch, both themes render correctly.

Slice-4 continuation is now fully done (avatar byline, collapsible cards,
`.bo-composer` — all three shipped and verified).
4. Filters/detail-forms:
   - [x] **Saved-view persistence** — the Slice 2 saved-views markup was
         static (hardcoded active chip, hardcoded field values); the real
         gap was that nothing DERIVED either from the URL. New opt-in
         behavior `initSavedViews()`: populates `.bo-filter-bar` fields from
         `location.search`, and marks whichever `[data-saved-views]` link's
         own querystring matches the current URL `aria-current="page"`
         (clearing it from the others). Doesn't invent a storage backend —
         views stay server-rendered links, this only keeps the UI honest
         about which one is active. 2 new tests (20 total, pass). Verified
         live: navigated with `?status=pending` in the URL, the select
         showed "Pending" and the matching chip was active — clicked
         "Overdue", URL/select/active-chip all updated together, both
         themes.
   - [x] **Multi-column detail-form patterns** — new pattern page
         `/patterns/detail-form`, the edit-screen counterpart to
         `/patterns/record-detail`. The CSS was already complete and
         already demonstrated on the Forms component page
         (`.bo-form-section`/`.bo-form-row`/`.bo-form-actions`); the actual
         gap was a missing COMPOSED pattern — a full multi-section purchase-
         order edit screen (header + payment/delivery fieldsets, a
         line-items table with seamless inline-edit inputs, a sticky action
         bar), matching the shape of the other 3 pattern pages. Zero new
         CSS. Verified live: 3-column layout at 1440px in both themes;
         forced a 300px container width and confirmed via computed layout
         that all 3 header fields stack into one column each (the
         `auto-fit` grid genuinely collapses, not just claimed to).

Slice 6 item 4 is now fully done (saved-view persistence + multi-column
detail-form patterns).
5. Runtime a11y pass — split into what this environment can and can't
   actually do (corrects an earlier assumption: VoiceOver was thought
   checkable here; it isn't — no AppleScript/System Events/Accessibility
   API access is available to drive it, only browser automation):
   - [x] **200% zoom geometry** — simulated via `document.documentElement.
         style.zoom` (real `Ctrl/Cmd +` shortcuts aren't scriptable through
         this session's browser tool either). Found and fixed a REAL bug:
         `.bo-navbar` had a fixed `height: 3rem` with no wrap, so at 200%
         zoom the Theme select was rendered fully off-screen (`right: 1189px`
         in a `757px` viewport) with no horizontal scrollbar to reach it —
         a genuine WCAG 1.4.10 Reflow failure, not hypothetical. Fixed:
         `flex-wrap: wrap` + `min-block-size` instead of a fixed `height`;
         verified live, re-measured (`right: 692px`, now on-screen), and
         confirmed zero regression at normal 100% zoom (still one line).
   - [x] **Print CSS static audit** — grepped every `@media print` rule
         across the codebase (can't render a literal print-preview
         screenshot without opening the native OS print dialog, which risks
         hanging browser automation the same way a JS `alert()` would).
         Found two real gaps from this session's own additions: a collapsed
         `.bo-widget__collapse` card would have silently vanished from a
         printout (fixed: forced open under `@media print`); an empty
         `.bo-composer` comment form would print as noise (fixed: hidden,
         same treatment as `.bo-filter-bar`/`.bo-form-actions`).
   - [ ] **VoiceOver verbalization** — NOT verified. No tool available in
         this session can drive VoiceOver; this needs a human on real
         hardware. NEEDS-RUNTIME.
   - [ ] **NVDA** — Windows-only, NEEDS-RUNTIME, unchanged from before.
6. [ ] **npm publish** `@busy-office/ui@0.1.x` — structurally ready (exports
       audited, tarball-tested via the consumer app); **owner-gated on
       "perfect"** — a loop iteration should not self-approve this.
7. [x] **Breadcrumb** — `.bo-breadcrumb`, added to `components/nav/` (folded
       into the existing "nav" umbrella component/docs page — navbar,
       sidebar-nav, and offcanvas already share one page there; consistent,
       not a new component dir). `<nav aria-label="Breadcrumb"><ol>` — a
       real landmark, not just styled links, so it's directly reachable by
       screen-reader landmark navigation. Current page is plain text (never
       a link) with `aria-current="page"` as the programmatic channel,
       emphasis ink as the visible one. Wraps rather than truncates on
       narrow screens — simpler, and a reachable ancestor beats an
       ellipsis that hides one. Wired into `/patterns/record-detail`, the
       exact use case this item named. Verified live, both themes.
8. More patterns (`apps/docs/src/pages/patterns/`):
   - [x] **Reporting dashboard** — `/patterns/reporting-dashboard`. Composes
         the breadcrumb (shipped last tick) + filter bar/saved views + a
         stat-tile row + a widget grid mixing a compact data table, an
         audit-style activity feed, and a collapsible notes card — nearly
         every piece built this session, in one realistic screen. Zero new
         CSS. Verified live: collapse toggle and theme switching both work
         correctly on the composed page (state persists through the theme
         change), both themes.
   - [x] **Settings & admin** — `/patterns/settings-admin`. Composes
         `.bo-tabs` (General/Users/Notifications), `.bo-form-section` +
         `.bo-form-row` fieldsets, `.bo-checkbox` for on/off preferences
         (no separate "switch" component invented — a labeled checkbox
         already covers the same setting, per the standing "one component,
         many settings" principle), and the data table + byline avatars
         for the user list. Zero new CSS. Verified live via Podman: all
         three tabs render correctly light + dark at 1440px; forced the
         main pane to 350px and confirmed via computed layout that
         `.bo-form-row` genuinely collapses every field to one column
         (single shared left edge) and the user table scrolls within its
         own container (`overflow-x: auto`) rather than blowing out the
         page — same verification method used for `/patterns/detail-form`,
         since this session's browser-resize floor still won't reach a
         literal 390px viewport. 20 tests pass, gates green.
   - [x] **Multi-step wizard** — `/patterns/wizard`. A real Back/Next flow,
         one panel visible at a time, distinct from `/patterns/detail-form`'s
         multi-*section* single screen. Needed a new opt-in behavior
         (`initWizard()`, `packages/core/src/js/behaviors/wizard.ts`) since
         the existing `.bo-stepper` is presentation-only (no JS): the new
         behavior keeps the stepper (`data-state="done"` / `aria-current`)
         and the visible `[data-wizard-panel]` in sync, disables Back on
         the first step, swaps Next for Submit on the last, and moves
         focus to each new panel (WCAG 4.1.3-style status handling for a
         panel swap that isn't a real navigation). Panels are plain
         `.bo-form-section` fieldsets — no new CSS. 3 new behavior tests
         (23 total, pass). Verified live via Podman: stepped through all 3
         panels in both themes at 1440px, confirmed focus lands on each
         new panel, confirmed Back re-enables/disables correctly at the
         edges, confirmed Submit only appears on the last step; forced the
         main pane to 350px and confirmed via computed layout the form row
         collapses to one column and the page doesn't horizontally
         overflow (this session's browser-resize floor still won't reach a
         literal 390px viewport, same workaround as the other patterns).
         **Not addressed this tick:** the `/concepts/js-behaviors` page's
         "five inits" table is now stale (lists 5, there are 8 —
         initDataGrid/initCollapsibleCards/initSavedViews were already
         missing before this tick, initWizard makes it 4 undocumented);
         flagging for the next Standardize pass rather than scope-creeping
         it into this item.
9. [ ] **RF-scanner / warehouse-scan components** — a real ERP gap: goods
       receipt (GR) / goods issue (GI) screens driven by a handheld RF
       scanner, not a mouse. Large-target scan-input field (auto-focus,
       auto-advance on a terminator character), a big-number quantity
       stepper, high-contrast/high-density variants for warehouse-floor
       screens. Seed it as an **Explore** spike first (see `LOOPS.md` Ideas
       backlog) — the interaction model is different enough from the rest of
       the library that it needs a try/error pass before committing to an
       API.
10. [x] **Demo-section ordering audit** (Standardize) — scripted a check
        across all 16 hand-authored pages (13 components + 3 patterns):
        found exactly one real violation, `alerts.astro`'s "Toast recipe"
        section — code-only, no live example at all (toasts are ephemeral,
        so the original author skipped rendering one). Fixed: a "Show
        toast" trigger button + `.bo-toast-region` now render a REAL toast
        above the code, matching what the code shows. Verified live: click
        renders the toast (bottom-end, both themes), dismiss removes it via
        the existing `initAlerts()` delegation — no regression. Every other
        flagged page was a false positive: either the sanctioned trailing
        "Markup" reference section (matches the recipe exactly) or a case
        where the live example lives in an earlier section on the same
        page. Clean pass otherwise — most of the codebase already follows
        the convention.
11. [ ] **Responsive audit (mobile + desktop)** — container queries already
        drive auto-compaction on data-table and a few others; audit that
        EVERY component looks intentional (not just "doesn't overflow") at
        both narrow and wide, not only the ones that happened to get a
        `@container` rule. Note: this session's browser tooling has a
        window-resize floor (~600px) that blocks testing true 390px in the
        live browser — verify affected components some other way (Podman +
        a real device/simulator, or a headless viewport tool) before
        checking this off.

12. [x] **Quantity field** (2026-08-14 user direction, wishlist) — shipped as
        `.bo-quantity` (`/components/quantity`), scaffolded via
        `new:component` to keep the docs-page shape gate-honest. Composes
        `.bo-btn`/`.bo-input--numeric` rather than inventing new visual
        primitives — the increment/decrement buttons ARE `.bo-btn
        bo-btn--secondary`, styled for free. A real `type="number"` input
        is the single source of truth for `min`/`max`/`step`; the new
        opt-in behavior `initQuantity()` reads those same attributes to
        clamp the buttons and keeps their `disabled` state in sync
        reactively (author renders the correct initial `disabled` if the
        starting value is already at a boundary — no eager DOM scan, same
        "swap-proof, not scan-proof" shape as the other behaviors). No
        `.bo-stepper` name collision (that's the wizard component).
        Warehouse-floor "large-target" variant is **not a new modifier** —
        `data-density="spacious"` (44px controls) already meets WCAG 2.5.8,
        so item 9's RF-scanner stepper can reuse this directly. Composes
        with `.bo-form-field` for the two-channel validation-error state
        (border + message + `aria-invalid`) — nothing quantity-specific
        needed there. 3 new behavior tests (26 total, pass).
        **Bug found and fixed during live verification, not caught by
        gates:** the docs-page demo markup omitted `.bo-btn` on the step
        buttons — CSS-valid, gates all passed, but the buttons rendered as
        unstyled native `<button>`s at the wrong size (spot-checked
        computed height: 27px vs. the intended ~36px). Caught by measuring
        computed height live rather than trusting the screenshot alone;
        fixed by adding `.bo-btn bo-btn--secondary` to every occurrence.
        Verified live via Podman: comfortable (36px) vs. spacious (44px)
        step-button height confirmed via `getComputedStyle`, light + dark
        both correct, boundary/unit/validation demos all render as
        intended, clicking the buttons live in-browser increments/
        decrements and clamps correctly. Narrow-width check used an
        isolated 320px off-DOM container instead of the usual
        forced-main-width technique (this page's right-rail TOC grid
        didn't shrink under that technique the way patterns pages did —
        a docs-shell quirk, not a component bug — confirmed the component
        itself has no fixed-pixel dependency: `max-inline-size: 12rem`
        plus flex content, same shape already used safely elsewhere).
13. [x] **Standardize: generated-docs drift** (dispatched after 4 Continue
        rounds) — `/concepts/js-behaviors`'s "five inits" table was
        genuinely wrong (hand-typed, actually 9 behaviors, 4 undocumented:
        `initDataGrid`/`initCollapsibleCards`/`initSavedViews`/`initWizard`).
        Rewrote it to generate from `@busy-office/ui/behaviors-manifest`
        (`dist/behaviors.json`), same pattern `ClassRef.astro` already uses
        for `dist/api.json` — marked `generated` so it can't drift again.
        Fixed a real bug surfaced by making the table honest: the
        generator (`extract-behaviors.mjs`) truncated long summaries
        mid-word at a hard 200-char cut; now cuts on a word boundary with
        an explicit `…`. Broader scan (Explore agent) found one more
        instance of the same anti-pattern: `/base/primitives.astro`
        hardcoded "four primitives plus the app shell" in prose — correct
        today but drift-prone (didn't consume the already-available
        `api.primitives`, unlike its sibling generated pages). Fixed the
        same way. Re-scanned the rest of the non-component docs pages
        (index, reference/classes, base/utilities, base/motion,
        base/colors) — all already correctly generated; clean pass, no
        further instances. 23 tests pass (unchanged), gates green.
14. [ ] **Amount: currency ISO code / custom currency** (2026-08-14 user
        direction, wishlist) — `.bo-amount__currency` today is a plain
        text affix (`$`, `EUR`, whatever the app passes in — see
        `/components/amount`); the ask is a first-class way to render a
        currency **symbol or ISO code** (USD, SGD, ...), including
        currencies the app defines itself (custom currency, e.g. an
        internal points/credit system). Needs scoping before a build
        round: is this purely a documentation/markup-convention update
        (e.g. a demo section showing `__currency` holding an ISO code,
        `Intl.NumberFormat`/`Intl.DisplayNames` as the *app's*
        responsibility to format — matching the existing "CSS-first, your
        app formats the number" contract), or does it need real new CSS/JS
        surface (e.g. a `title`/tooltip for the expanded currency name, a
        `--code` modifier so ISO codes get different tabular spacing than
        symbols)? Likely the former — Amount is already explicitly
        markup-driven for this exact reason — but flagging for a real
        Continue round to confirm rather than assuming. Accept (draft,
        refine at build time): existing AA/two-channel contract
        unaffected; custom (non-ISO) currency strings render exactly like
        any other `__currency` value today (no allowlist/validation baked
        into CSS).
15. [ ] **Quantity: base-unit symbol / standard &amp; custom units, with
        per-unit default (but overridable) decimal precision**
        (2026-08-14 user direction, wishlist) — the mirror ask for
        `.bo-quantity__unit`: today it's plain text (`ea`, `kg`, `box` —
        see `/components/quantity`); the ask is explicit support for a
        base-unit **symbol or code**, covering ISO/standard units (kg, m,
        L) AND units an ERP customer defines itself (a custom UOM) —
        **plus** each unit type carrying a sensible default decimal
        precision (e.g. `ea`/`box` default to 0 decimals, `kg`/`L` default
        to 2-3) that the app can still override per field. That precision
        piece is the one part of this ask that is NOT just a markup
        convention — a real "which unit -> how many decimals" default
        table is application/domain data, not CSS, so this is likely an
        **app-level lookup + `step`/formatting convention we document**
        (e.g. `step="0.01"` on the `<input>` already expresses precision
        natively; the open question is whether busy-office-ui ships a
        reference default-precision table for common units as documented
        guidance, or leaves that entirely to the consuming app). Confirm
        the split (CSS/JS surface vs. documented convention vs. app-owned
        data) in a real Continue round rather than assuming here. Also
        check whether `.bo-quantity__unit` and `.bo-amount__unit` should
        cross-reference each other's docs (both exist independently,
        added in different slices) — candidate for a future Standardize
        pass if they drift. Accept (draft, refine at build time): custom
        (non-standard) units render like any other `__unit` value today;
        per-unit decimal defaults are overridable, never hardcoded as a
        silent app-wide constant.

## Long term (post-1.0)

Highest-leverage bets (2026-08-14 review — ranked):

- [x] **Scaffold generator + page-shape gate** *(top pick)* — `npm run new:component
      <name> [--behavior]` (packages/core/scripts/new-component.mjs) stamps the CSS
      file + `@import`, the docs-page skeleton, the sidebar entry, and (with
      `--behavior`) a stub test in one command; `apps/docs/scripts/check-page-shape.mjs`
      is build gate 7, FAILING a component page missing its opener/`ClassRef`/demo/
      `ApiTable`/non-empty `Related`/sidebar entry. Caught two real drifts (button.astro,
      form.astro missing the demo-note opener) on first run — fixed. Turns the CLAUDE.md
      "how to document" prose into something that can't be gotten wrong.
- [x] **Keyboard row navigation — Explore spike (2026-08-14)** — j/k/Enter roving
      focus on a plain `<table>`; mechanics confirmed live, but discarded as unsafe
      (breaks screen-reader table browse mode). Graduated into Slice 6 item 2 above
      as the properly-scoped ARIA grid pattern.
- [ ] **1.0 exit checklist, then ship** — the real risk isn't technical, it's that
      "owner-gated on *perfect*" never resolves. Write a short, checkable list (N
      components, a11y ledger cleared, API frozen, ≥1 real consumer), hit it, publish
      1.0, iterate under semver. Perfection is the enemy of adoption.
- [ ] **Real ERP pilot (dogfood)** — build one real back-office screen (an approval
      queue, a PO form) with the framework and feel where it fights. The only test of
      "good for hundreds of ERP screens" that synthetic demos + grills can't give.

- [ ] **Framework adapters** (`integrations/`) — a Vite plugin for à-la-carte imports,
      a thin React/Vue wrapper set, a Rails/Django asset recipe. Opt-in, never a core
      dependency.
- [ ] **Versioned docs** — the CHANGELOG covers pre-1.0 churn; at 1.0, snapshot docs
      per major so pinned users read their version.
- [ ] **Theme presets** — a small set of validated brand palettes (each passing the
      contrast gate) as `brand-*.css`, demonstrating the semantic-tier re-skin.
- [ ] **Visual-regression harness** — screenshot diffing across density × theme in CI,
      so the "looks right" pass becomes mechanical like the rest.
- [ ] **Turbo** — adopt if the workspace grows past ~2 packages (build caching).
- [ ] Component depth: data-grid virtualization hooks, date-field component,
      tree/nav for deep ERP hierarchies. (Amount field and command palette pulled
      forward into Slice 5.)
- [ ] Localization/RTL audit as a first-class pass (logical properties already
      throughout; verify end-to-end).

## Standing principles (not a phase — the bar every slice meets)

- Every documented surface is generated from the shipped artifact and drift-gated.
- Every state signal is two-channel (visible non-color cue + programmatic).
- Every `@container` is named; heights are minimums; density is rem-only.
- New components compose existing primitives; small and general over specific.
- Before adding a class, ask whether it's a genuinely reusable ERP setting (an
  existing component's new part/modifier) or a one-off — prefer widening what
  exists over shipping a narrow variant (2026-08-14 user direction).
- Every component is responsive by construction (container queries, relative
  units) at both narrow and wide — not verified only at whatever width
  happened to be open when it shipped.
- Each slice is adversarially grilled before sign-off.
