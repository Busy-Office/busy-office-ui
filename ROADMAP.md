# busy-office-ui — Roadmap

A CSS-first ERP UI framework: semantic components, density-aware tokens, modern CSS,
generated-and-verified docs. This file is the long-term plan; per-slice detail and the
design-review trail live in `.roundtable/`, and every breaking change is in
`CHANGELOG.md`.

## Objective — the direction (set by the owner, 2026-08-16)

**Make complex ERP UI simple: the framework absorbs the hard problems so
the app doesn't have to.** Every proposal to add, change, or remove
anything passes the three principles below — each carries explicit
**accept / refuse / rethink** tests so decisions are made against the
direction, not against momentum. Anything that fails a test is refused
outright or sent to the design panel; "it would be useful" is never
sufficient on its own.

### 1. Simplicity — simple is the best; make the complex simple

The framework's job is to take on genuinely hard problems (accessibility
contracts, precision, density, theming, focus, save semantics) and hand
back something that reads obvious. Power that complicates the consumer's
markup or mental model is failure, not capability.

- **Accept** when it lets a consumer *delete* code, markup, or decisions.
- **Refuse** when using it correctly requires understanding more than its
  own docs page, or when its explanation needs a caveat list to be honest.
- **Rethink** when a docs explanation keeps growing to cover a surface —
  the fix is simplifying the thing, never the prose. (Precedent: the
  lossless-reformat fix — the simple contract "never change the number"
  replaced a growing pile of rounding caveats.)

### 2. Less for more — fewer options, more possibility

One component, many settings. Composition over variants. Native elements
over invented widgets. Every new option must open more use-cases than the
one that asked for it.

- **Accept** when one general mechanism replaces N specific asks
  (precedent: `data-density="spacious"` IS the warehouse-floor variant —
  no `--large` modifier ever shipped).
- **Refuse** a modifier/part/attribute that serves exactly one scenario,
  and any second way to do something that already works.
- **Rethink** when two surfaces start growing toward each other — merge
  them or extract the shared primitive (precedent: the `decimal-input`
  util under money + quantity).

### 3. Reusability is the key

Nothing ships for one screen. A piece earns its place by surviving ≥2
real, independent compositions (the same bar behaviors already meet
before being called stable). Prefer the primitive that composes over the
composite that locks.

- **Accept** when it works, unchanged, in a context it wasn't designed
  for.
- **Refuse** when it embeds app/domain decisions — data, workflow,
  policy stay with the consumer ("framework does visuals, you do the
  data"); the rare deliberate exception is named, documented, and always
  overridable (precedent: the currency/unit tables).
- **Rethink** when reuse requires copy-paste-modify — extract the
  reusable core instead of shipping the copy.

**Precedence (owner call, 2026-08-21): suitability beats reuse at the
point of use.** Reusability decides what SHIPS in the framework;
context-suitability decides what a screen USES. When they conflict — a
reusable control that is wrong for the context (steppers in a dense
line grid; the joined money widget crammed into a table cell) — the
suitable design wins, because an unsuitable design damages the UX no
matter how reusable it is. The resolution is always to pick or build
the suitable REUSABLE primitive (the field matrix on
`/concepts/design-language` says which, per field type × context),
never a one-off.

### 4. Design the decision, not the screen (added 2026-08-19, owner input — the Ive filter)

A screen exists to serve **one decision its user must make**, and everything on
it is ranked by that decision. "The payroll manager needs to know whether
payroll is safe to release" is a design brief; "we need a payroll screen" is
not. Complexity lives under the interface, never in the user's mental model —
the system may run fifty validations, the user reads *Ready · 428 employees ·
2 exceptions*.

- **Accept** when the screen answers, in order, *what is this / what should I
  look at / what should I do* — and the primary action is singular and obvious.
  (Measured 2026-08-19: 18 of 19 pattern screens already have ≤1 visually
  primary action; the wizard's Next/Submit pair is the legitimate exception —
  never both visible.)
- **Refuse** any element whose removal does not materially reduce the user's
  ability to decide — and any state text that names the mechanism instead of
  the meaning (`Processing Status: 04` is refused; "Ready to release" with
  detail underneath is the shape). If an element needs a long explanation to
  justify existing, that is the signal it should not.
- **Rethink** when a screen accumulates a second primary action or a second
  audience — it is usually two decisions sharing one page, and the fix is a
  split, not a bigger toolbar.

**The screen's decision lives inside a journey** (owner input, 2026-08-20 —
the full Ive document's §4): a decision is one step of Request → Validation →
Exception → Resolution → Approval → Execution → Confirmation, and a beautiful
screen inside a terrible workflow is still a bad product. The unit of design
is the journey; screens are its steps.

- **Accept** when a screen's exits land the user at the next decision with
  context intact — the approval screen's "done" IS the confirmation state,
  not a dead end the user navigates away from blind (precedent: po-app's
  edit → 302 → record-with-new-values, and the mass-change 422 that
  re-renders in place instead of losing the user's selection).
- **Refuse** a screen designed in isolation — one whose entry assumes state
  no prior step produces, or whose exit drops the user somewhere no next
  step picks up. If the pattern page cannot say which step precedes and
  follows it, that's the signal.
- **Rethink** when a journey needs a screen that exists only to bridge two
  others (a "now click here to continue" page) — the fix is merging the
  handoff into an exit, not adding a step.

The full 10-question version of this filter runs on demand as `/design-grill`
against a named screen — or against a whole journey as
`/design-grill flow:<a> > <b> > <c>`; this section is the every-wake
distillation.

**References are floors, not ceilings** (owner, 2026-08-23, during the
RF-coverage grill): research citations prove a need RECURS — they never
define the solution. Parity with SAP/Fiori/Zebra/anyone is not an Accept
criterion; every design must name what it does BETTER than the reference
it cites (typically: two-channel state, no-JS floor, reduced-motion and
forced-colors correctness, honest docs, composition over new surface). A
proposal that cannot name its improvement is copying, and gets rethought.

**How it binds the loops:** Roadmap triage tests every new ask against
these before queuing (refuse/rethink are valid triage outcomes, recorded
with the reason); the design panel grills slices against them; removals
face the same tests as additions — deleting a surface consumers compose
against is a Breaking-entry decision, not a tidy-up.

## CI strategy — measured, and why branches are not the lever (2026-08-24)

Owner asked whether a dev/main split should manage different CI. **It should
not, and the timing data says why: CI was slow for a structural reason, not a
branching one.**

Measured before changing anything: ~12.4 min of serial steps, lopsided —
scroll 216s (29% of the run), claims 104s, axe 68s, layout 65s, container 59s.
Eleven browser gates each launched a browser and walked the same 121 built
pages.

Fixed structurally, **without touching branches**: sharding the browser gates
into five parallel jobs took wall clock to **184s**. Plus `paths-ignore` for
narrative-only commits (8 of the last 30 touched only `.roundtable/**` and
`STATUS.md`) and `cancel-in-progress` for superseded pushes. Roughly **4x**,
with no change to what any gate asserts.

**Why NOT tier gates by branch.** This file's own doctrine already answers it:
*a gate that only runs in CI is not known to work.* The corollary is worse — a
gate that only runs on `main` finds problems **after** the merge, which is the
expensive moment to find them. Cheap-on-dev / full-on-main also trains you to
trust a green that means less than it says. Same gates everywhere; make them
fast instead. At 3 minutes there is nothing left to tier.

**Branches ARE worth it — for a different problem.** Twice on 2026-08-24 the
owner and the loop edited the same working tree simultaneously: once an
independently-written ledger entry was swept into an unrelated commit by
`git add -A` (which is how two gaps briefly shared the number 17), and once a
whole slice (139) was found already implemented and uncommitted. Branches plus
separate worktrees remove that contention entirely, and `fix/docs-search-bar`
showed the shape working. So: **branch for isolation and review, not for CI
tiering.**

**Standing rules that follow:**
- Same gate set on every branch and on `main`.
- `main` protected, requiring CI green.
- Anything that reads a file must not be in `paths-ignore` — `DESIGN.md`,
  `ROADMAP.md`, `LOOPS.md`, `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` are each read by
  gate scripts, so none of them may be ignored. Only `.roundtable/**` and
  `STATUS.md` are read by nothing.
- Re-measure before optimising again. The single biggest win here was a loop
  written the wrong way round, and no amount of workflow tuning would have
  found it.

## Sequence — what runs next, and why in this order (owner, 2026-08-24)

Eighteen items are open; **nine are dispatchable** and nine are gated on the
owner or on a condition — *the count as it stood on 2026-08-24; see the note
above.* The order below is the plan of record. It is derived
from one finding rather than from item age: the instrument grill
(`.roundtable/grill-erp-suite-instrument-2026-08-24.md`) showed that **every
gap the ERP suite has found came from a new SHAPE or from STRESS, and none
from a new domain** — 9, 4, and 0 of the seventeen. So the remaining modules
are ranked by the shapes they force, not by module order.

| # | Item | Why here |
|---|------|----------|
| 1 | **140.3** — predictions on record | Must precede the modules. A yield predicted *after* building is worthless; the whole value is that it can be wrong. Cheap — recording, not building. |
| 2 | **130.4a Production** | Highest predicted yield: BOM as a multi-level hierarchy, capacity over time, the MRP panel. Also where **140.1's reopened question** — intensity over a long date grid — gets tested on a real screen instead of a screenshot. |
| 3 | **130.4b Inventory** | Stock by item × warehouse. Predicted **not** a gap (`comparison` documents a candidates × criteria grid; `data-table` ships `--sticky-col`). Building it either confirms that or proves the prediction wrong. |
| 4 | **130.4c Finance** | Journal entry that must balance, payment list + detail. Predicted **~0 gaps** — all shapes covered. This is the thesis test: a module that finds nothing is a **success**, and the evidence for stopping at shape coverage. |
| 5 | **130.5** — wire the suite into CI | Its own condition is "once it stops changing shape". That is true only after 2-4 land. Ordered last among suite work on purpose: a gate guarding a moving target reports noise. |
| 6 | ~~**136.6 / 136.7**~~ — **both REFUSED 2026-08-24** | The instrument did what this row predicted, and refuted them. 25 ERP screens express document relationships as a document-flow timeline (5) or a related list (2), and use rich text on **zero**. A reference belongs in a structured surface GAP-2 already resolved, not in prose. 136.7's general question — a character counter for the form family — is re-homed as open, not queued. |

**Gated, not sequenced** — these are not "later", they are waiting on someone:

- **112.3** pilot briefs → owner (the loop must never author brief content);
  **112.4** blocked on 112.3's verdict; **112.5** after both.
- **OWNER CALL — direction**: precondition met (0.3.0 cut), awaiting the
  owner's push + GitHub Release.
- **AT runtime evidence**: needs owner hardware — a screen reader this loop
  cannot drive.
- **Turbo**: conditional, and its condition (workspace past ~2 packages) is
  not met.
- **185.2 — register the npm Trusted Publisher for `@busy-office/create-ui`**:
  needs the owner's npm account, wizard at hand
  (`register-create-ui-trusted-publisher.sh`, walked through 2026-08-29,
  not committed — one-off). `@busy-office/ui` already went through the exact
  same sequence (`ROADMAP-archive.md`: manual `0.1.0` publish by the owner,
  then Trusted Publisher registered, then `0.1.1` shipped with SLSA
  provenance) — this is the same step for the second package, not a new
  kind of gap. Two consequences of leaving it unregistered, as the owner
  named them: (1) `create-ui@0.1.0` carries no attestation a consumer can
  verify the build against, unlike `ui@0.5.0` — and that specific version
  can never be retrofitted, since a published version can't be republished,
  so every release skipped here is provenance lost permanently, not just
  deferred; (2) the next real release strands the scaffolder again exactly
  the way 185's original finding described, unless this is registered
  first — `publish.yml` ships create-ui unconditionally after core, so an
  unregistered Trusted Publisher fails that step outright rather than
  silently skipping it. *(The owner referenced this as "ADR-06" — no ADR-06
  or any `docs/adr/` file exists in this repo as of 2026-08-29; recorded
  here rather than assumed, since `domain-modeling`'s ADR support isn't
  wired into this project yet.)*

  **In progress 2026-08-29 (owner, via the wizard).** The npmjs.com panel was
  opened and the form was mostly filled correctly (Publisher GitHub Actions,
  org `Busy-Office`, repo `busy-office-ui`, workflow `publish.yml`) — but a
  screenshot showed **Environment name pre-filled with `@busy-office/ui`**,
  which is wrong: `publish.yml` has no `environment:` key at all
  (`grep -n 'environment:' .github/workflows/publish.yml` returns nothing),
  so an OIDC token from this workflow never carries that claim and saving it
  as-is would make every future publish fail. Flagged before save; owner was
  told to clear that field and leave it blank, matching what `ui`'s own
  config almost certainly has.

  **No wake can verify the save happened, and neither can `npm view`.**
  Browser automation to npmjs.com is blocked at the Claude-in-Chrome
  extension's own site-permissions level (confirmed by two navigation
  attempts, both refused before any page loaded) — not a login issue,
  a hard stop, and account-settings changes like this belong to the owner
  directly regardless. More load-bearing: **the registry has no field that
  states "Trusted Publisher: configured."** It only ever shows *provenance
  on an already-published version*, stamped at publish time — so
  `create-ui@0.1.0` will read no-provenance permanently no matter what gets
  configured now, and there is no query against the registry that proves
  registration today. The only proof is the next `npm publish` actually
  succeeding via OIDC (or failing loudly, if something is still
  misconfigured) — which only happens at the next real, owner-triggered
  release. `npm view @busy-office/create-ui` is not a valid check for this;
  don't try it as a substitute for a screenshot or the owner's own
  confirmation.

  **RESOLVED 2026-08-29 — the browser block above was per-origin, not
  absolute.** The owner added `npmjs.com` to the Claude-in-Chrome extension's
  site permissions; `www.npmjs.com` (the redirect target) stayed blocked but
  the bare `npmjs.com` origin worked, so navigation succeeded from there.
  **Confirmed directly, not inferred**: the Trusted Publisher panel shows a
  saved entry (`Busy-Office/busy-office-ui`, `publish.yml`, permissions `npm
  publish` + `npm stage publish`); opening its Edit form (via a real
  extension-driven click, not a synthetic DOM event — see 200.1/200.2's own
  caught bugs about the difference) shows Organization `Busy-Office`,
  Repository `busy-office-ui`, Workflow filename `publish.yml`, and
  **Environment name genuinely empty** — the earlier mis-fill was corrected
  before saving, exactly as flagged.

  **What this does and does not prove, stated precisely rather than
  overclaimed.** This confirms the *configuration* is now correct. It does
  **not** prove OIDC actually authenticates — as recorded above, that has
  exactly one proof and it is the next real release publishing
  `create-ui` successfully. Configuration-correct and publish-correct are
  different claims; only the first is closed here.

  **CLOSED 2026-08-29 — the second proof landed.** `v0.6.0` was cut (owner
  confirmed, release created via `gh release create v0.6.0`), `publish.yml`
  ran green end to end, and `Publish create-ui to npm (OIDC, with
  provenance)` — the step that only passes if the Trusted Publisher
  actually authenticates — succeeded. Confirmed against the registry
  directly, not inferred from the green run:

  ```
  npm view @busy-office/create-ui version               # 0.1.1
  npm view @busy-office/create-ui dist.attestations      # predicateType: slsa.dev/provenance/v1
  ```

  `create-ui@0.1.1` carries SLSA provenance — the trust-surface hole named
  at the top of this item is closed for every version from here forward;
  `0.1.0` stays permanently unattested, as already established.

**What would change this order.** If Production finds three or more gaps, the
shape thesis is holding and Inventory/Finance stay as written. If Production
finds **zero**, the thesis is wrong in an interesting way — the remaining
modules would be re-argued rather than ground through, because the instrument
would have stopped paying for itself.

## Slice 252 — Standardize sweep: lanes 1-3 clean a TWELFTH time, lane 4 dispatched the tenth archive sweep (13 slices, the largest single move since 228.1), and the fifth lane found the BCD walk hand-copied into both floor scripts (2026-09-03)

**Dispatcher trace, cloud wake.** Rule 1: no open P0 — `list_issues` on
`Busy-Office/busy-office-ui` returns `totalCount: 0`, and the three open slices
are 15 (owner-hardware AT evidence), 112 (owner briefs) and 249 (the triaged
adoption proposal). Nothing new to triage, so Step 1 committed nothing. Rule 2
fired: `dispatch_status.py` read `Standardize 4 / 4 Continue rounds OVERDUE`.
Rules 3-8 not reached.

*Read before quoting rule 5:* `dispatch_status.py` reports it **STALE**
(1 wake-date of loop activity newer than the newest comparable pair, itself
`axe-violations`). Per LOOPS.md's own instruction this rule **could not be
evaluated** this wake — it is not being reported clear. This wake records a
fresh `axe-violations` sample so the next one has a live pair.

1. [x] **252.1 — DONE 2026-09-03. All four standing lanes clean; the finding
       came from lane 4, and it is the archive sweep `RESUME.md` had already
       flagged as "a real signal, not yet acted on".**

       ```
       npm run scan:dead-style -w docs                 # lane 1 of 4
       npm run report:css-repeats -w @busy-office/ui   # lane 2 of 4
       npm run report:prose -w docs                    # lane 3 of 4
       python3 scripts/loops/report_loop_prose.py      # lane 4 of 4
       ```

       - **Lane 1 — `scan:dead-style`: 0 dead on 0 pages, 1,433 live inline
         declarations**, screen + print, with 0 declarations dead on screen but
         live in print. Identical to 244.1's and 237.1's readings.
         *Trap re-hit and worth one line:* this lane needs `CHROME_PATH`
         exported in the same command (ENVIRONMENT 1c). Its first run here died
         with "No Chrome/Chromium found" — a **loud** failure, which is the
         behaviour that rule wants, not a quiet skip.
       - **Lane 2 — `report:css-repeats`: zero delta, compared member for
         member rather than by count.** 74 source files · **242** rules with 3+
         declarations · **230** distinct bodies · **8** repeated — the same
         three totals as 244.1 and 237.1, and the same eight groups by their
         named selectors: x4 joined-control radius (money ×2, quantity ×2), x3
         list reset (approval-workflow, sidebar-nav, tree), x3 visually-hidden
         (sidebar-nav, stepper, primitives) and the five x2 pairs. The x4 group
         is still **two components**, so its stated reopen trigger — a THIRD
         component — is unmet.
       - **Lane 3 — `report:prose`: zero unverdicted pages, checked by SET
         MEMBERSHIP.** 118 documentation pages of 127 built · median **748** ·
         total **105,963** words. Nine over 2x the corpus median and twelve over
         a family median; the union is **fourteen distinct pages**, and **14 of
         14 are inside the verdicted set** — 158.1's twelve, 161.1's three and
         178.3's `/concepts/scale/`.

         *This was checked by set membership, not inherited from 244.1's
         identical-looking numbers.* Four docs pages have changed since Slice
         244 (`git log --name-only <244>..HEAD -- apps/docs/src/pages`), so
         equal totals do not prove an equal SET, and the verdicted list was
         re-extracted from the archive rather than quoted:

         ```
         awk 'NR>=17533 && NR<=17740' ROADMAP-archive.md \
           | grep -oE '/(components|patterns|concepts|base|getting-started|reference)/[a-z0-9-]+/' | sort -u
         ```

         The obvious instrument here stays refused: 228.1 recorded that grepping
         each page path out of `ROADMAP.md` + the archive returns hits for all
         fourteen whatever the truth is, and re-running it here reproduces that
         — a **non-zero count for 14 of 14**, which is why it decides nothing.
       - **Lane 4 — `report_loop_prose.py`: no file changed accumulate class,
         `ratchet` block read first.** `CLAUDE.md` **30 up, never cut** (29 at
         244.1) and `DESIGN.md` **22 up, never cut** are 167.1's standing
         verdicts, and `CLAUDE.md`'s watch was executed and **retired** by
         193.1, so neither is re-raised. `LOOPS.md` `6 up, last cut 9198e43f`;
         `RESUME.md` `0 up, last cut 0a5bde3a`. Every file the loop reads every
         wake has a cut behind it except the two 167.1 adjudicated.
         **The finding is `ROADMAP.md`'s regrowth**, which is what this lane
         carries: `roadmap_scope.py` read closed-history share
         **2,087 / 3,790 = 55.1%**, 14 eligible targets.

2. [x] **252.2 — DONE 2026-09-03. The tenth archive sweep: 13 closed slices
       moved verbatim, `ROADMAP.md` 3,790 → 1,917 lines at the move, and one
       eligible target refused because an open item's Accept names it.**

       Slices **251** (51 lines), **250** (28), **248** (73), **247** (99),
       **246** (138), **245** (144), **244** (257), **243** (166), **242**
       (214), **241** (212), **240** (156), **239** (168) and **238** (219)
       moved, in the order they held in the live file, each leaving the
       standard heading + one pointer line.

       **Slice 237 was NOT moved**, and that is 236.2's rule executing rather
       than a judgement call: `roadmap_scope.py`'s dependency line names it as
       *"named by the open item at Slice 249"* — `249.12`, the archival-trigger
       question, whose Accept is about Slice 237's own text. Slice 249 itself is
       open and stays. Closed-history share **55.1% → 9.1%** (175 / 1,917).

       *Two different line figures, both true, kept apart because ENVIRONMENT's
       "read a commit's figure from that commit" bullet was broken twice by
       exactly this conflation:* the **move** took `ROADMAP.md` 3,790 → **1,917**;
       this **commit** carries 3,790 → **2,117**, because writing this slice back
       is the rest. `ROADMAP-archive.md` 32,443 → **34,368**. All four read from
       the index (`git show :<file> | wc -l`) and `HEAD`, never from the tree.

       **Verification is a second, independently written parser**, and it reads
       the PRE-MOVE source (`git show HEAD:ROADMAP.md`) rather than the mover's
       memory, splitting on `^## ` boundaries where the mover indexed lines. Per
       slice it asserts: the block appears **exactly once** in the archive
       verbatim, its interior is **absent** from the live file, and the live
       file carries heading + pointer. It also asserts Slices 249 and 237 are
       still intact live.

       **Both arms red-proved by injection, with the injection confirmed to have
       landed** — CLAUDE.md's rule that a green red-proof is a defect in the
       injection until proven otherwise:

       - *Archive arm.* One interior line of Slice 244's archived block was
         mutated. Confirmed landed by counting the block in the archive
         **1 → 0** and the marker present in the file; verifier went red
         (`archive holds the block 0 time(s), expected 1`), exit 1.
       - *Removal arm.* Slice 239's interior was appended back into the live
         file. Confirmed landed by reading the property before/after
         (`False → True`); verifier went red (`block interior STILL present in
         the live file`), exit 1.

       Restored both times, verifier back to exit 0.

       **`check:slice-refs` 709 → 722, and the +13 reconciles exactly.** A swept
       slice number heads a section in **both** files, so each earns one extra
       uniqueness check — thirteen slices, thirteen checks. Cited citations hold
       at 262 and the known-dangling baseline at 2; live slice sections stay
       **233**, because a pointer stub keeps its heading. Both figures were read
       by running the gate at `HEAD` (via `git stash`) and on the swept tree,
       not derived.

       *The committed tree reads **723 / 234**, one more of each*, and that is
       this slice's own heading arriving — the same +1-per-new-section arithmetic,
       applied to a section that heads only the live file. Stated separately
       because 709 → 722 describes the SWEEP and 709 → 723 describes the COMMIT,
       and quoting either for the other is the conflation the line-count note
       above is also about.

3. [x] **252.3 — DONE 2026-09-03. Lane 5 — the divergence scan step 1 names and
       no instrument covers — found `compatOf` hand-copied into both floor
       scripts. Consolidated into `packages/core/scripts/bcd-compat.mjs`.**

       Same lane that produced 166.2, 209.2 and 244.2. The scan:

       ```
       grep -rhoE '^(async )?function\*? [a-zA-Z0-9_]+' \
         packages/core/scripts apps/docs/scripts scripts/loops \
         --include=*.mjs --include=*.py | sed 's/^async //' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
       #   2 function exists      -> NOT a duplicate: different args, different
       #                             workspaces (a file path vs a URL path)
       #   2 function compatOf    -> the finding, both in packages/core/scripts
       ```

       **Diverged, not byte-identical**, which is why it survived: `derive-floor`
       threw inside the walk at the first missing key, `check-rf-floor` after
       the loop. The two produce the **same message about the same full path**
       — only the script-name prefix differs — so this was two spellings of one
       rule, not two rules.

       **Why two copies earned a module when two copies usually do not.**
       `check-rf-floor.mjs`'s own header records this exact cost, paid in this
       exact file: its `--self-test` *"used its own copy of the walk logic and
       happened not to exercise this exact call, so it stayed green while the
       real gate was inert"* — against a build with an unguarded `color-mix()`
       injected straight into it. Its stated conclusion is *"Sharing one
       function is what makes a bug in it show up in --self-test too"*. The
       argument for the module is written by the file that learned it.

       What is NOT folded: the two scripts stay deliberately opposite in
       technique (derive-floor asks what floor the CSS supports; check-rf-floor
       asks whether it ever requires more, unguarded). Only the dictionary
       lookup both do identically is shared, and `who` is threaded through so
       each still names itself in the error.

       **Verified behaviour-neutral, on a truly clean `dist/`** (`rm -rf
       packages/core/dist`, per the Continue playbook's build-ordering rule):
       `dist/floor.json` is **byte-identical** across the refactor, 4,843 bytes,
       `diff` empty — and it is a generated artefact of the very function that
       moved. `check:rf-floor` passes and its `--self-test` passes.

       **Red-proved by injection at BOTH call sites**, injections confirmed
       landed before believing either result. `['css','selectors','has']` was
       replaced with a non-existent key in each script; each threw from the
       shared module carrying **its own label** —
       `derive-floor: no BCD entry at css.selectors.ZZNOSUCHKEYZZ` and
       `check-rf-floor: no BCD entry at css.selectors.ZZNOSUCHKEYZZ`. Both files
       restored, marker count back to 0.

**Not verified, said plainly.** This is a cloud wake: there is no Podman and no
`localhost:8081`, so the 1440/390 light-and-dark screenshot lane could not run.
Nothing here rests on a rendered image — the diff is two markdown files plus
three build-time Node scripts, none of which the docs site renders, and the one
behavioural claim (`floor.json` unchanged) is a byte comparison. All **17** CI
entry points, re-derived from `ci.yml` rather than read off `ENVIRONMENT.md`'s
snapshot, ran green in this container: `test:axe` 127 pages × 2 widths zero
violations, `check:layout` 127 pages, `check:scroll` 912 containers across 118
pages × 2 widths, `suite` 28 screens × 2 widths, `check:po-app` 19 behaviours,
`check:quickstart`, `check:pseudo` 14 pages, 152 unit tests.
`check:claims` reads **162 verified live / 3 NOT VERIFIED**, which is
ENVIRONMENT 6b's container property (`(hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)` is
false in headless Chrome) and not a regression.

## Slice 251 — 247.1 built: every live `file:line` citation into a rewritten/regenerated file is already self-documenting, and the one actual defect was in the handover file's own drift, not the roadmap's

Closed — archived verbatim in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.

## Slice 250 — Objective grill of Slices 244, 245, 248: 28 of 28 claims reproduce, both red-proofs executed live, and the append-only citation-stability property survived an intervening rebase it could not have anticipated (2026-09-03)

Closed — archived verbatim in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.

## Slice 249 — Triaged from an external docs-adoption-surface proposal (2026-09-03)

**Input**: a 16-item proposal comparing this repo (`5b3ab697`) against
`DibbayajyotiRoy/RoyUI@0e29468` plus eight reviewer notes, covering the "first
thirty seconds of contact" gap: bundle-size budget, page metadata, terminology,
maturity labels, a "choose your path" router, README, install commands, docs
recipe ordering, generated taglines, a visual catalogue, DESIGN.md's split, a
stability field, an outward "not for you" page, plus three open owner
questions and a lane of refusals. Full triage:
`.roundtable/grill-adoption-proposal-2026-09-03.md`.

**Every citation that a verdict depended on was re-run against the live tree
before trusting it**, per this file's own "a number you report is
load-bearing" rule — not read off the proposal's own text. Two did not
survive:

- The terminology-table item's own worked example was **backwards**:
  cited `components/offcanvas.astro` as missing the word "drawer"; the page
  actually uses "drawer" as its dominant vocabulary (15+ occurrences across
  headings, IDs, prose, and its own wrong-choice clause). No gap exists
  between the two cited pages.
- An "incidental" browserslist-vs-derived-floor mismatch is **not a
  defect** — `derive-floor.mjs`'s own header states it is deliberately
  independent of browserslist, computed from shipped CSS via BCD precisely
  because a hand-typed floor was once wrong. A derived floor one minor
  version above the declared browserslist target is the expected
  relationship. Refused as 94.11 ceremony — the predicate would be
  near-permanently true.

Everything else re-checked (bundle-size gate absent, page metadata absent,
DSA/floor/AT-evidence sourcing, README's 0 images/0 FAQ, install page's
npm-only, the recipe's demo-first/spec-last gate and its exact source
position, the hand-written sidebar/task-tile arrays, DESIGN.md's length and
dated-section count, the absent stability field) reproduced exactly as
claimed.

1. [x] **249.1 — DONE 2026-09-03. Bundle-size budget gate.**
       `packages/core/scripts/check-size.mjs`, wired into `build` as
       `check:size` immediately before `stamp-readme --check`. Eleven budget
       buckets cover all **139** shipped CSS/JS artifacts; every number is a
       gzip ceiling at current + ~10% headroom.

       **The premise needed correcting first, and the correction shaped the
       design.** "No bundle-size gate exists" is true of 138 of 139 artifacts,
       not of all of them —

       ```
       grep -rn -i budget packages/core/scripts packages/core/package.json .github/workflows
       ```

       returns exactly one enforcement: `build-rf-essentials.mjs`'s
       `RF_BUDGET_KB = 40` (roadmap 126.1), a MINIFIED-byte ceiling on one
       bundle, inline in the script that builds it. It is kept, not replaced —
       it defends an argued membership list, this gate defends transfer
       weight, and they fail for different reasons and read differently. So
       this generalises a precedent rather than inventing one.

       **gzip, against 126.1's explicit argument for minified bytes.** That
       argument (zlib-build drift; the 2026-08-16 CI failure on identical
       source) was about an EQUALITY check on a published string. Every number
       here is a ceiling with ~10% headroom. The claim is not left as an
       assertion that can go stale: the gate recomputes and prints the
       **tightest headroom in the whole table, in bytes**, on every run —
       today 110 bytes, `css/brand-navy.min.css`.

       **Red-proved live, four arms; each injection was confirmed to have
       LANDED before its red was believed.**

       - *per-file* — 2,062 bytes of unique CSS appended inside
         `data-table.css`'s `@layer` block.
         `grep -o 'bo-data-table--probe-' | wc -l` counts **28** in each of
         `dist/css/components/data-table.min.css`, `index.min.css` and
         `rf-essentials.min.css`; `npm run build -w @busy-office/ui` then
         exits 1 **at `check:size`**:
         `data-table.min.css is 2.28 kB gz > per-file budget 2.2 kB`.
       - *unbudgeted file* — a `dist/css/themes/nordic.css` no bucket claims:
         exit 1, the file named. A new shipped artifact must be budgeted
         deliberately, never absorbed by a wildcard.
       - *stale row* — `dist/css/brand-*.min.css` moved aside: exit 1,
         "budget row matched no shipped file". The reconciliation runs both
         ways.
       - *blown total* and *a multi-file bucket declaring no per-file max* —
         `--self-test`, which pins the classifier (14 cases) and the
         comparator (5) through the ONE `bucketOf`/`findBreaches` pair the
         real run uses, per check-rf-floor.mjs's lesson.

       **What the item did not name, and it decides the design: a
       group-total-only gate would have been GREEN on exactly the injection
       the Accept prescribes.** 2 kB of source CSS is **+0.37 kB gz**.
       `css/components/*.min.css` went 24.75 → 25.12 against a 27.3 budget,
       and `css/index.min.css` 15.10 → 15.53 against 16.7. Only the per-file
       arm fired. So both arms ship, and a bucket holding more than one file
       that declares only a total is itself a gate failure: a total alone lets
       one component balloon while its neighbours shrink, and a per-file max
       alone lets ten new components each land just under it.

       Current tree: 139 payload files, **371.7 kB gz** total. Not budgeted,
       with counts printed every run so the exemption cannot grow quietly:
       8 `.json` (build-time data, not per-page browser payload) and 31
       `.d.ts` (types, stripped before anything ships).
       - **Accept:** met. Fails on injection (four arms above), passes on the
         current tree, and raising a budget is a one-line diff — measured,
         not asserted: changing `css/components/*.min.css`'s `max` from 2.2 to
         2.4 produces a diff of exactly **-1/+1**.

2. [ ] **249.2 — Per-page metadata: description, sitemap, robots.** `Gallery.astro`
       gains a required `description` prop (new `check-page-shape` arm fails a
       page without one); `@astrojs/sitemap`; a one-line `robots.txt`; one
       static OG image site-wide.
       - **Accept:** `grep -L 'name="description"' dist/**/*.html` returns
         empty; `dist/sitemap-index.xml` lists every built page; `check-links`
         stays green.

3. [ ] **249.3 — Maturity labels with a real source.** Per component page:
       DSA-scored date (`dsa-scores.json.scored`), introduced-version (first
       tag containing the component's CSS file, computed at build), floor
       (per-component `derive-floor.mjs` run), AT evidence rendering "none
       recorded" until the owner-blocked item closes (STATUS.md's open `AT
       runtime evidence` row).
       - **Accept:** every label on the built page traces to a key in `dist/`
         or `src/data/`; a component with no score renders the stated-absence
         string, never blank.

4. [ ] **249.4 — README: stamped gate count, one screenshot, who-for/not-for,
       FAQ.** `stamp-readme.mjs` gains a gate-count marker (count of
       `check-*.mjs` carrying `--self-test`); one hand-made screenshot
       (`patterns/list-report` at `data-density="compact"`, labelled as
       hand-made in alt text); the existing two "Not for" clauses from
       `scope.astro` as a for/not-for line; the five `troubleshooting.astro`
       headings as a linked FAQ.
       - **Accept:** `stamp-readme --check` still exits 0; both READMEs carry
         ≥1 image.

5. [ ] **249.5 — Install commands for pnpm/yarn/bun, or a recorded refusal.**
       `getting-started/installation.astro` shows npm only today. Add the
       three, or file a one-line DA stating the no-bundler audience makes it
       noise — either closes this.

6. [ ] **249.6 — "Choose your path" router, corrected from the proposal's
       own miscited version.** The proposal's evidence ("index.astro:118, one
       CTA") was wrong — that line is the install snippet, and the page
       already has 2 CTA buttons, 4 nav links and 6 task-tiles. The real gap:
       every existing router (nav, tiles) sorts by *component category*, none
       by *adoption scenario* (add to existing app / new app / CSS-only / with
       behaviours / htmx / custom theme). A six-row block on `index.astro`,
       each row ending in a rendered screen — the theming row currently has
       none, so it needs one re-themed screen-kit example or the row is cut.
       - **Accept:** each row's terminal page contains a `Demo` or pattern
         link, asserted by a `check-learning-path`-style arm; a row ending in
         prose alone fails.

7. [ ] **249.7 — Terminology table, re-scoped after its own worked example
       failed verification.** Drop the offcanvas/drawer pairing (refuted
       above — no gap exists). Before landing `src/data/terminology.mjs`,
       spot-check every remaining seed row (select/dropdown/combobox/value
       help/F4, grid/table/ALV, snackbar/toast/notification,
       master-data/CRUD/maintain, wizard/stepper/guided-procedure) the same
       way A3's citation was checked — against the actual built pages, not
       assumed. Hold the SAP/Fiori-specific rows (value help, ALV, guided
       procedure, F4, message, maintain) for 249.10 (owner vocabulary).
       Three consumers once seeded: a visible "Also called" line under
       `<h1>` (Pagefind-indexed), a `check-search.mjs` `@exact` arm per
       alias, and a glossary in `gen-llms.mjs`.
       - **Accept:** every row's claimed gap is independently reproduced by
         grepping the two pages it names, the same check that refuted the
         offcanvas row; deleting a row from the table turns its search arm
         red.

8. [ ] **249.8 — Component tagline + category, generated from the CSS
       header.** `/* @tagline … @category … */` in each component's CSS
       header, lifted into `api.json` by `extract-api.mjs`. Deletes two
       hand-written lists this repo's own gates already police drifting
       (`Gallery.astro`'s sidebar array, `index.astro`'s task-tile prose) and
       feeds 249.2's description, 249.7's terminology line, and 249.9's
       catalogue cards.
       - **Accept:** a stub component CSS file with the header updates
         sidebar/tiles/llms with zero hand edits on rebuild; omitting the
         header fails the build naming the file.

9. [ ] **249.9 — Visual component catalogue.** Depends on 249.8 (tagline) and
       249.3 (maturity labels). `/components/` index: one card per component
       — name, tagline, CSS-only/JS-enhanced/JS-required (derived: component
       classes ∩ `behaviors.json` hooks), DSA score + date, floor, AT line,
       pattern links, a build-time miniature via `browser-harness.mjs`
       (already exists, used today for patterns via `PatternPreview.astro`).
       - **Accept:** every badge on a card traces to a JSON key; the
         miniature-rendering build-time cost is measured and stated before
         this closes.

10. [ ] **249.10 — SAP/Fiori terminology column for 249.7.** Owner
        vocabulary — value help, ALV, guided procedure, F4, message, maintain.
        **OWNER CALL.**

11. [ ] **249.11 — "Migrate an existing admin UI" path.** No page exists.
        Which stack is the entry point decides whether this is one page or a
        pattern family. **OWNER CALL.**

12. [ ] **249.12 — Archival trigger for `ROADMAP.md`.** The archive-sweep
        *practice* exists (Slices 224, 228, 235.2, 237.1 all did one); no
        stated trigger (on slice close? every N slices?) exists. **OWNER OR
        ARCHITECTURE CALL** — low urgency, the sweep keeps happening
        regardless.

**Sent back to the owner rather than dispatched, because the proposal's own
justification doesn't hold:**

13. [ ] **249.13 — Reconsider demo-first/spec-last (the proposal's B1),
        explicitly, not as a ratification.** The facts check out exactly —
        `data-table.astro`'s Markup section is its 18th and last `<h2>`,
        `check-page-shape.mjs` gates the position with test cases proving it.
        But the proposal argues for reversing it as "1 reviewer beats 0
        readers," which misstates the 2026-08-16 decision: that call came
        from comparing four established framework docs sites with zero
        exceptions found for demo-first/spec-last (this file, then
        `CLAUDE.md`, states the comparison explicitly). The proposed reversal
        (Markup moves to position 2, spec tables stay generated-only at the
        end) is a defensible design on its own merits and costs only moving
        one block — but reversing a dated, gated, cross-referenced decision is
        the owner's call to make with the real tradeoff in front of them, not
        something a triage settles by itself. **OWNER CALL**, recommended
        default: keep spec-last unless the owner weighs the new evidence
        against the original four-site comparison and prefers the change.

**Refused, recorded as DA (not re-litigated here — see the triage file for
each item's reasoning):** publish-on-every-push/auto-bump, a `registry.ts`
model for component metadata, thirteen mandatory page headings, hand-typed
stability/tested badges, `COMPATIBILITY.md` as prose, `docs/decisions/`
duplicating `.roundtable/`, per-page generated OG images, a bundlephobia
badge, an npm keyword blob, Preview/Code tabs (already decided, roadmap 118),
search-side query expansion, and framework-owned column persistence.

**Concurred without a new item** (already correctly scoped, or resolved by
an item above): the visual-catalogue and split-DESIGN.md items (B3→249.9,
B4→ not separately filed, folds into ongoing `.roundtable/` practice already
in place — `DESIGN.md`'s Principles-only split and a `CONTRIBUTING.md` are
low-risk and can be built directly without a triage item; flagged here so a
future wake doesn't re-propose it from scratch), and the stability-field item
(B5, folds into 249.8's CSS-header convention once that lands — declaring
`stable`/`experimental`/`deprecated` as a field is a small extension of the
same `@tagline`/`@category` header mechanism, not a separate design).

## Slice 248 — Component-by-component design-grill: 40 of 40 covered, 1 real defect fixed, one instrument caught lying to itself (2026-09-02)

Closed — archived verbatim in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.

## Slice 247 — 245.1 built: both of 244.3's counts corrected against a named revision, and upholding the "leave the log row alone" bullet found that bullet's OWN citation pointing at the wrong row (2026-09-02)

Closed — archived verbatim in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.

## Slice 246 — 244.4 built: the src/css chokepoint gets its gate, and the design question it carried is answered by a count nobody had taken — there are FOUR chokepoints in this repo, one of them gated (2026-09-02)

Closed — archived verbatim in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.

## Slice 245 — Objective grill of Slices 238, 241, 243, 244: twenty-nine of thirty-one published claims reproduce, and the two that do not are ONE item's two counts of one set — six and eight against a tree holding five before and seven after (2026-09-02)

Closed — archived verbatim in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.

## Slice 244 — Standardize sweep: all four standing lanes clean, and the finding came from the fifth thing the playbook names — `cssFiles` hand-copied four times, one of them already diverged (2026-09-02)

Closed — archived verbatim in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.

## Slice 243 — 242.1 refused: arm 8 does not become a build gate, and neither of the two arguments its Accept anticipated is what decided it — the predicate is unsound in the one direction nobody injected, red-proved by a score that stays correct while the arm goes red (2026-09-02)

Closed — archived verbatim in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.

## Slice 242 — Polish round 2 on `component/dashboard`: the seventh recorded defect is the first where the SCORE was wrong, not the cite — `interaction: na` on a component that ships a behaviour, blind re-scored to 3 by a second agent (2026-09-02)

Closed — archived verbatim in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.

## Slice 241 — 240.1 closed on its OWN second branch: the chevron's two hex literals are not removable, measured four ways — and the item was never browser-blocked, only its first branch was (2026-09-02)

## Slice 240 — Polish round 2 on `component/calendar`: six arms clean, and a SEVENTH finds the sixth recorded defect — the one cite in the framework that claims an absence the shipped CSS does not have (2026-09-02)

Closed — archived verbatim in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.

## Slice 239 — Polish round 2 on `component/tree-table`: NO-OP on six arms, and the sixth is the class arm 5 structurally cannot see — where 3 of this ledger's 5 recorded defects lived (2026-09-01)

Closed — archived verbatim in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.

## Slice 238 — Objective grill of Slices 232, 234, 236, 237: twenty-four of twenty-five published claims reproduce, and the one that does not is the count written BESIDE a premise that was correctly re-run — five archive commits reported as four, at two durable sites (2026-09-01)

Closed — archived verbatim in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.

## Slice 237 — Standardize sweep: lanes 1-3 clean an ELEVENTH time, lane 4 dispatched the ninth archive sweep, and the file that sweep writes into was still instructing the opposite of the rule written beside dispatcher rule 4 the day before (2026-09-01)

**Dispatcher trace, cloud wake.** Rule 1: no open P0, and GitHub intake
`list_issues` OPEN → `totalCount: 0`, so Step 1 had nothing to triage and no
`Roadmap · plan` row was recorded. Rule 2: **`Standardize 4 / 4 Continue rounds
OVERDUE` — dispatched.** Rule 3 read `Objective 3 / 3 slices OVERDUE
[232, 234, 236]` and stays armed behind it, which is Step 2's stated order
working, not a rule being skipped.

**All four lanes ran; `n of 4` is 4 of 4, per the playbook's own instruction.**

**Lane 1 of 4 — `scan:dead-style`: clean.** 0 dead declaration(s) on 0 pages,
1,433 live inline declarations, screen + print measured. It needs
`CHROME_PATH` exported in the same command, like every other browser-driven
gate here — without it the scan exits 1 naming six paths it tried, which reads
like a failure and is a missing export.

**Lane 2 of 4 — `report:css-repeats`: clean, and the delta is what was read,
never the count.** 74 source files · **242** rules with 3+ declarations · **230**
distinct bodies · **8** bodies appearing more than once, against LOOPS.md's
table (2026-08-28) of 237 · 225 · 8. The repeat set is unchanged **member for
member** — x4 joined-control radius (money ×2, quantity ×2), x3 list reset
(approval-workflow, sidebar-nav, tree), x3 visually-hidden (sidebar-nav,
stepper, primitives), and the five x2 pairs. The x4 group is still **two
components**, so its stated reopen trigger — a THIRD component — is unmet. Rules
and distinct bodies both moved by +5 with repeats flat, which is only consistent
with added rules carrying novel bodies; that is a derivation from the three
totals, not a separate measurement of what was added.

**Lane 3 of 4 — `report:prose`: clean, checked by SET MEMBERSHIP.** 118
documentation pages of 127 built · median **748** · total **105,705** words.
Nine pages over 2x the corpus median and twelve over a family median; the union
is **fourteen distinct pages**, and every one resolves against **158.1's
twelve**, **161.1's three** and **178.3's** `/concepts/scale/` — sixteen
verdicted pages, nothing flagged outside them. 228.1 already recorded why the
obvious instrument here is a dead one (grepping each page path out of
`ROADMAP.md` + the archive returns hits for all fourteen whatever the truth is),
so membership against the sixteen is what was checked.

*One instrument artefact worth a line, because it is the trap CLAUDE.md names
under its own heading.* Extracting the flagged page paths with a
`/[a-z-]+/[a-z-]+/` regex over the report's output returns **fifteen** paths,
and the fifteenth is `/script/style/` — matched out of the report's own
explanatory sentence, *"with pre/script/style/svg/template removed"*. A page
list that contains a substring of the sentence explaining how pages are
measured. Caught by reading the list, not by a check.

**Lane 4 of 4 — `report_loop_prose.py`: carries the finding, and it is the same
one as last wake.** The `ratchet` block read first, per the playbook:
`ROADMAP.md` **4 up, last cut `574a8634` (2026-09-01)**. `roadmap_scope.py` read
closed-history share **1,410 / 2,907 = 48.5%** — up from 31.6% at the previous
hand-off — with targets `[236, 235, 234, 232]`, and 236.2's new dependency lane
read *"no target slice is named by a still-open item"*. **The archive sweep is
due a ninth time**, and the hand-off had already assigned it here rather than to
the Continue round that spent rule 4.

1. [x] **237.1 — the ninth archive sweep. Four slices moved, and the
       verification reads the SOURCE rather than the mover's own memory.**
       *Accept was*: each target slice present byte-identical in
       `ROADMAP-archive.md` and absent from `ROADMAP.md`, one pointer line left
       behind per slice, `check:slice-refs` green, and its reported count
       reconciled rather than accepted.

       ```
       python3 scripts/loops/roadmap_scope.py        # targets, share, 236.2's lane
       npm run check:slice-refs -w docs
       ```

       **Moved:** 236 (381 lines), 235 (368), 234 (161), 232 (500) — boundaries
       read one slice at a time from the heading line to the next `## `, and a
       block already reduced to a pointer refused outright (235.3's lesson).
       `ROADMAP.md` **2,907 → 1,509 lines**; closed-history share **48.5% →
       0.0%**; live-file slice count unchanged at 218, because a sweep moves
       text, not slices. **Both are AT MOVE TIME** (177.1's convention): writing
       this result block back into the file is itself growth, so the committed
       file reads higher and `roadmap_scope.py` reads a non-zero share again —
       carrying exactly one closed slice, this one.

       **The verification is a second, independently written parser** that
       re-derives each block from `git show HEAD:ROADMAP.md` — the pre-move
       source in git — and asserts it appears exactly once in the working-tree
       archive and zero times in the working-tree live file. Comparing against
       the mover's in-memory copy would have been self-consistent by
       construction, which is CLAUDE.md's *reconcile against the SOURCE, not
       against the argument*. **Red-proved by injection**: one line of the
       expected block replaced, the injection confirmed to have landed (archive
       count for that slice 1 → **0**), verifier FAILED 1 of 4 and exited 1;
       clean run 4 of 4 ok, exit 0.

       **`check:slice-refs` moved 680 → 684, and the +4 is not new citations.**
       Measured against a `git worktree` at `HEAD` rather than reasoned about:
       distinct slice headings in the archive **212 → 216**, in the live file
       unchanged at 218, so the gate's uniqueness arm runs 430 → **434** checks
       while its citation arm holds at **250** (252 cited − 2 known-dangling).
       A swept slice number heads a section in *both* files — the pointer stub
       and the real section — so it earns exactly one more uniqueness check.
       +4 for four slices is the tidy number this repo says to distrust, and it
       reconciles. On the committed tree the gate reads **685 / 219**, one more
       than the sweep produced, because Slice 237 is a new live-file heading and
       earns its own uniqueness check.

2. [x] **237.2 — the archive's own header instructed the opposite of the rule
       `LOOPS.md` gained the day before, and that sentence has a measured
       cost.**
       *Accept was*: the header stops asserting a rule that contradicts
       dispatcher rule 4's standing answer, and points at where the rule lives;
       the header's falsity re-measured here rather than quoted from 236.2;
       every other copy of the claim in the tree found and adjudicated.

       `ROADMAP-archive.md`'s header (110.4, 2026-08-22) read *"Nothing here is
       edited — corrections to history go in new slices, never here."*
       `LOOPS.md` beside rule 4 (236.2, decided 2026-09-01) reads *"Amending the
       archive is allowed and expected for a correction"* and *"'Archived
       verbatim' is a property of the MOVE, not a claim of immutability."* Two
       documents, opposite instructions, one day apart, neither naming the
       other — the shape this playbook already records costing 44 minutes
       between a gate being hardened and demoted.

       **The premise re-run, not quoted** (CLAUDE.md: when the premise is an
       earlier wake's measurement, re-checking it is part of the criterion):

       ```
       git log --format='COMMIT %h %ad %s' --date=short --numstat -- ROADMAP-archive.md
       # 10 commits · 8 pure appends (the sweeps) · 2 with NO move:
       #   d3d76a28 (199.1)  +27 / -0   a RE-VERIFIED block appended INSIDE an archived slice
       #   dc861a25 (235.3)   +0 / -12  three self-referential stubs deleted
       ```

       **The cost, and it is specific.** 177.1 (2026-08-28) found Slices 17, 23
       and 24 each heading two sections in the archive, the second a three-line
       stub pointing at the file it was already in, named all three — and left
       them, **"on the archive's own authority"**, quoting this header verbatim.
       `dc861a25` deleted exactly those three on 2026-09-01. **Five** commits
       landed on the file in between — the command, since this figure was
       published without one and was wrong for four days (238.1):

       ```
       git log --format='%h %ad %s' --date=short 2ae54a4a..dc861a25^ -- ROADMAP-archive.md | wc -l
       #   5 — 574a8634 (235.2), d701e619 (228.1), e29c7c18 (214.1),
       #       83192cd1 (208.1), d3d76a28 (199.1)
       ```

       A correct twelve-line deletion was deferred four days by a sentence that
       was already false when it was read.

       **Corrected 2026-09-01 by 238.1; `+0 / -12` above was `-0 / -12` in the
       same commit.** As first published this paragraph read *"Four commits
       landed on the file in between (`d3d76a28`, `83192cd1`, `d701e619`,
       `574a8634`)"* — `e29c7c18` (214.1, the sixth archive sweep, `+1,575`) was
       dropped, and it is the middle of three consecutive `— Nth archive sweep`
       subjects. The conclusion, the ten-commit premise above and the *"four
       days"* figure are unchanged and were each re-run before this edit.
       **The Slice 238 grill row in `.roundtable/loop-log.md`, and the copy of it
       `STATUS.md` renders, still carry the wrong phrase and are deliberately
       left wrong** (grep the row — neither is cited by line number, because
       238.1 filed both as `:1279` / `:43` and both had already moved by the time
       it closed): `record_iteration.py`'s standing
       rule is that historical rows are never edited, so the figure is immortal
       in the log — which is the whole reason the two durable sites had to carry
       the correction. The grill report
       `.roundtable/grill-objective-232-234-236-237-2026-09-01.md` quotes the
       pre-correction wording as a dated finding and is likewise not edited.

       **Scope checked, and two near-misses left alone.** A fixed-string sweep
       for the claim (`Nothing here is edited`, `corrections to history`,
       `never edited`, `byte-identical to what stood`) finds the header, 177.1's
       own quotation of it, and two hits about **loop-log rows** being never
       edited — `record_iteration.py`'s standing rule, a different rule about a
       different file, correctly untouched.

       **Refused: restating rule 4's paragraph in the header.** 236.2 already
       decided the standing answer lives in `LOOPS.md` beside the rule, and lane
       4 of this very sweep is the instrument that measures this file growing.
       The header carries the correction, the measured cost and a pointer — 5
       lines to 22 — not a second copy of the rule.

## Slice 236 — Objective grill of Slices 232, 233, 234, 235: every published figure reproduces except one, and the two findings are both about what a verification CANNOT see — a corroborating count that measures its own explanation, and a sweep that archived the target of an open item's Accept (2026-09-01)

Closed — archived verbatim in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.

## Slice 235 — Standardize sweep: lanes 1-3 clean a TENTH time, and lane 4's finding is that the sweep's own instrument has never had a file — five runs, one copy, living inside an archived slice. Committing it exposed two owner calls no run could see, and the sweep it enabled exposed three self-referential stubs in the archive (2026-09-01)

Closed — archived verbatim in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.

## Slice 234 — 232.2's closing measurement is wrong about its own headline: the defect was introduced by 42.1, the commit that WROTE the sentence, and both dispatchers confirmed the opposite from the same single-file probe (2026-08-31)

Closed — archived verbatim in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.

## Slice 233 — 231.2's new prose asserts two computed facts and nothing executes either; found by the THIRD independent build of 231.2 (2026-08-31)

Closed — archived verbatim in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.

## Slice 232 — Objective grill of Slices 229, 230, 231: 230 and 231 survive entirely, and both findings are against how 229's refusal RECORDED its numbers, not against the refusal (2026-08-31)

Closed — archived verbatim in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.

## Slice 231 — Polish round on `component/alerts`: the reconciliation is a NO-OP, and the sweep that surrounded it found one shipped variant with no recorded reason anywhere (2026-08-31)

Closed — archived verbatim in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.

## Slice 230 — Standardize sweep: lanes 1-4 clean a ninth time, and the drift carried for three wakes was a genuine one-off — 5 of 6 parsing pages already asserted (2026-08-31)

Closed — archived verbatim in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.

## Slice 229 — Objective grill of Slices 222, 226, 227, 228: every decision survives, the best candidate finding was already gated, and the one mirror no gate can see is fixed (2026-08-31)

Closed — archived verbatim in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.

## Slice 228 — Standardize sweep: lanes 1-3 clean an eighth time, and lane 4 carries the finding again — the archive sweep is due a SEVENTH time (2026-08-30)

Closed — archived verbatim in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.

## Slice 225 — Objective grill of Slices 218, 219, 223, 224: a citation that quoted its own re-run command into permanence, and everything else held (2026-08-30)

Closed — archived verbatim in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.

## Slice 224 — Standardize sweep: three of four lanes clean, and the fourth found a stale trap in the file Step 0 reads every wake (2026-08-30)

Closed — archived verbatim in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.

## Slice 223 — owner call: move the shipped htmx integration and both example apps to htmx 4, dropping `apps/docs`'s boosted navigation in the process (2026-08-30)

Closed — archived verbatim in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.

## Slice 222 — `check:po-app` after 211.1: the previous wake's open question, answered by measurement — 2 of 19 becomes 1 of 19 here, and 19 of 19 on CI (2026-08-30)

Closed — archived verbatim in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.

## Slice 221 — Owner direction: pin htmx to 4, and plan the framework update. Slice 114's refusal is SUPERSEDED, and its own reopen condition is half-met (2026-08-30)

Closed — archived verbatim in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.

## Slice 220 — Polish round on `breadcrumb`: the count-bearing cite class pays out a second time, and the pick was a filed defect rather than a tie-break (2026-08-30)

Closed — archived verbatim in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.

## Slice 219 — the `aria-current` pairing gate stops at the docs dist, and the one violation it would have caught lived outside it (2026-08-30)

Closed — archived verbatim in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.

## Slice 217 — Polish round on `sidebar-nav`: a cite that was EXACT when written and decayed two days later, and the count-bearing class measured at 6 of 240 (2026-08-30)

Closed — archived verbatim in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.

## Slice 216 — Polish round on `data-table`: a DSA cite that was already stale on the day it was scored, and a cloud wake lapped by 37 slices (2026-08-30)

Closed — archived verbatim in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.

## Slice 215 — Objective grill of Slices 211, 213, 214: the open item's refusal cites a page that does not say it, and every container htmx measurement ran a version the app does not ship (2026-08-30)

Closed — archived verbatim in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.

## Slice 214 — Standardize sweep: lanes 1-3 clean for the sixth time, and lane 4 carries the finding again — the archive sweep is due a SIXTH time, one day after the fifth (2026-08-30)

Closed — archived verbatim in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.

## Slice 213 — P0: a windowed-list spacer is sized from ONE sampled row that is not representative, so every evicted chunk is 49px short and re-loading it jumps the scroll (2026-08-30)

Closed — archived verbatim in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.

## Slice 212 — Objective grill of the 200/208/209 window: a refusal's own base rate missed the declaration its cited gate names in its header, and the arming set needed narrowing for the third grill running (2026-08-29)

Closed — archived verbatim in `ROADMAP-archive.md`.

## Slice 112 — External governance/conformance proposal, grilled to a pilot (2026-08-22)

Owner supplied a rev-3 "Documentation, Governance & Conformance Improvement
Proposal" (uploaded 2026-08-22) proposing a consumer-facing validator
(`@busy-office/check`), a Screen Contract YAML, pattern metadata, a Quality
Index, waivers/SARIF/benchmarking, and a six-section docs IA. Reviewed
against the repo: **most of its P0 already exists here under other names**
(Surface Fitness ≈ the DSA rubric; admission gate ≈ the 99.4 front door;
mandatory doc cores ≈ the two recipes + `check-page-shape`; canonical
generated metadata ≈ the docs doctrine). The genuinely new bets were the
Screen Contract + pattern-fit layer. Grilled in a 2-round design-tree
session (report: `.roundtable/grill-112-pattern-fit-proposal.md`); the
owner's deciding call: **the checker is for AI agents building with the
framework** — not human enterprise teams. Final decision made on long-term
benefit: build the metadata substrate unconditionally; every superstructure
stays evidence-gated.

**Sequencing (settled Q5): this slice queues BEHIND 110.4 and 109.3.**
109.3's per-section quality bar is what the pilot judges against, and
109.3 grows the 13 outstanding wrong-choice clauses (settled Q9 — one pass
per page, not two).

1. [x] **112.1 — DONE 2026-08-22. `patterns.json` extracted, `gen-patterns.mjs`.**
       Self-tested (`--self-test`, red-proved by breaking the row regex and
       confirming the cases meant to catch it went red), reconciled by hand
       against 9+ pages including edge cases (a nested `<code>` tag inside
       a Data-contract cell, a wrong-choice clause with no alternative
       link). Wired into the docs build chain right after
       `gen-patterns-index.mjs`. No new drift gate added — 112.1's own
       Accept asked only for the extractor to be red-proved, not for a
       staleness gate; adding one would be scope creep beyond what was
       asked. Original item text follows.
       `patterns.json`, extracted not authored. A
       `gen-patterns.mjs` scrapes the pattern pages (the single source of
       truth stays the pages, per doctrine) into a generated per-pattern
       record: group, opener, complexity, components-used, the States
       table rows, the Data-contract table rows, and the wrong-choice
       clause text + its alternative link (today detected then thrown
       away by `wrong-choice-rule.mjs`). **Anatomy is deliberately out of
       scope** — its `<li><strong>Region</strong>` convention fuses
       component links into prose (approval's entries carry
       parenthetical asides a naive extractor would swallow); extract it
       only after a page-side convention tightening earns it. Technique
       precedent: `check-components-used.mjs`'s section-slice against
       dist. Red-prove the extractor per the instrument doctrine — first
       output is wrong until reconciled against a hand count.
2. [x] **112.2 — DONE 2026-08-22.** `llms.txt` gained a `## Patterns`
       section generated from `patterns.json`: per pattern, name/URL,
       opener, complexity, components, and the wrong-choice clause +
       alternative link — the task-fit data an agent needs to pick the
       right SHAPE before reaching for components (Objective §4). Kept
       lean deliberately: full States/Data-contract row text stays on
       the page itself, not duplicated here — including it would have
       roughly doubled the file for detail a pattern-fit decision
       doesn't need. Same anti-drift guard as 32.3's precedent (throws
       if the catalogue is missing or under 20 patterns), red-proved by
       truncating `patterns.json` to 2 entries and confirming the build
       actually threw before restoring it. File grew 22.9kB → 36.7kB,
       53 → 81 URLs verified. Full suite green (13 docs gates incl. the
       URL-resolution check on all 29 new pattern links; `check:claims`
       90/90).
3. [ ] **112.3 — the pattern-fit pilot. BLOCKED ON OWNER BRIEFS + FOUR
       ANSWERS (grilled 2026-08-29 at the owner's request; full report
       `.roundtable/grill-112.3-pilot-still-worth-it-2026-08-29.md`).** The
       block is now *precise*: every precondition the pilot set for itself has
       landed, so briefs are the only remaining input, and four questions
       decide whether they are worth spending.

       - **All four self-imposed gates are met.** Substrate complete
         (`patterns.json`: 39 patterns, **39/39** carrying states, data
         contract and wrong-choice); llms.txt coverage present (83
         `patterns/` refs for 39 pages); 110.4/109.3 landed; wrong-choice debt
         down to 1, and that one is the deprecated `date`.
       - **Part of the superstructure already shipped without the verdict.**
         Q7 said the "Which pattern should I use?" page comes *after* the
         verdict; it shipped as 112.5, generated from `patterns.json`. Half of
         Q7 honoured (canonical source), half not (no verdict). **Recorded,
         not actioned** — the decision with teeth gated only 112.4, and
         un-shipping a generated docs page to satisfy a sequencing clause
         would be ceremony. What it does establish: the verdict no longer
         gates anything a wake can build, only 112.4, which is itself blocked
         on 112.3. A closed loop with the owner on both ends.
       - **The suite answers a NEIGHBOURING question for free** — whether a
         correctly-picked pattern's anatomy suffices (GAP-17, 6 of 7 list
         screens). It must NOT count toward the bar: it measures completeness
         rather than discovery, and it was produced by an agent with repo
         access, so counting it is self-approval.
       - **"Briefs are burn-once" is asserted, not established** — the pilot
         agent is specified llms.txt-only with no repo access, so a fresh
         session arguably cannot see a brief that lives in the repo. Marked
         Hypothesis: the isolation is unverified.

       *Owner decisions needed (recommendations in the report):* is the pilot
       still worth the briefs (**yes, as 112.4's admission gate only**); how
       many (**five, not eight — the bar is an absolute count, so eight raise
       the hit-rate, not the standard**); does suite evidence count (**no**);
       and are briefs re-runnable (**test it with one brief before believing
       either way**).

       **OWNER DECISION 2026-08-29: agree, all four recommendations.** Pilot
       proceeds as 112.4's admission gate only; **5 briefs**, not 8; suite
       evidence (GAP-17-style) does **not** count toward the bar; and the
       burn-once assumption gets tested rather than believed — run the first
       real brief, then re-run that same brief text in a fresh no-repo session
       and compare the two agents' picks/answers before treating any brief as
       spent. If they diverge, brief scarcity is confirmed and 5 stands; if
       they agree, briefs are a re-runnable regression test and the "scarce
       resource" framing that blocked this for weeks no longer applies.

       **Still blocked on one input no wake can supply: the owner writing 5
       real ERP screen briefs with sealed picks.** Nothing else in this item
       is dispatchable until at least the first brief exists in
       `.roundtable/pilot-112/briefs.md`.

       *(original item, unchanged below)*

       **Original item, kept verbatim — BLOCKED ON OWNER BRIEFS —
       protocol owner-confirmed 2026-08-23, scaffold ready.** The owner
       agreed to the protocol (after stress-testing the loop's format
       example — the duplicate-check-vs-reconciliation challenge, which
       also confirmed why briefs must be owner-authored). Scaffold at
       `.roundtable/pilot-112/` (README + briefs.md + SEALED-PICKS.md);
       the loop wrote only the scaffold, never brief content. Waiting on:
       5–8 briefs + sealed picks, then "briefs ready" starts the runs.

       **Realigned 2026-08-24 — still blocked, but with new evidence the pilot
       should account for.** The ERP suite has since built 25 screens from
       these patterns, and GAP-17 found `list-report`'s Anatomy omitted a whole
       region (the create action) — an omission that propagated into **6 of 7
       list screens**. That is real pattern-fit failure data from a different
       direction than the pilot measures: the pilot asks whether an agent
       PICKS the right pattern from the docs; this says a correctly picked
       pattern's own anatomy can be incomplete. It argues for the Screen
       Contract layer's premise without satisfying the pilot's verdict bar,
       which is deliberately about sealed owner picks.
       *(pre-registered protocol follows, unchanged)*
       32-style evidence before any contract surface exists. Protocol,
       pre-registered here so the verdict cannot be argued afterward:
       - **Briefs**: the owner writes **5** screen briefs from real ERP
         memory (revised down from 5-8 by the 2026-08-29 owner decision
         above — the bar is an absolute count, not a rate, so 8 only
         raised the odds of hitting it at 60% more owner time), unseen
         by the loop before the runs, each with the owner's own pattern
         pick sealed in a file the pilot agent can never see.
       - **Agent context**: a fresh subagent gets the brief text plus the
         IMPROVED `llms.txt` (post-112.2) ONLY — no repo access. One
         control brief re-run with nothing but the npm README.
       - **Runs**: one run per brief; any failing brief is re-run twice
         and the failure counts only if it appears in ≥2 of 3
         (variance guard).
       - **Measurement**: the full failure taxonomy, each row arguing
         for its own defense separately — pattern choice, invented
         APIs (regression check on 32.1/32.2), missed states,
         right-pattern-wrong-component (the 42-fields-in-a-Dialog
         class), contract violations.
       - **Verdict bar**: confirmed wrong-pattern picks (vs the sealed
         owner picks) on **≥2 briefs** → the Screen Contract layer earns
         admission and gets designed (112.4). Below the bar → **refused
         and recorded**; 112.1/112.2 stand on their own merits either
         way. Report lands in `.roundtable/`.
4. [ ] **112.4 — Screen Contract layer. BLOCKED ON 112.3's verdict.**
       Deliberately undesigned until admitted — schema, delivery
       (extend `bo-check-markup` vs new bin), and finding format are the
       post-pilot grill round. If 112.3 refuses it, this item closes as
       refused with the pilot report as the reason.
5. [x] **112.5 — DONE 2026-08-25, generated from `patterns.json` as required. UNBLOCKED
       2026-08-24 — the coupling to 112.3 cost more than it saved.** A
       task→pattern decision-flow page generated from `patterns.json` (never
       hand-maintained — it would be the fifth interpretation of the pattern
       system the proposal itself forbids).

       It was sequenced after the 112.3 verdict so the page and any contract
       pattern-selection logic would be one authoring pass from one source — a
       real saving, but a small one, and this item's own last line already said
       it **pays regardless of 112.4's fate**.

       **Realignment:** 112.3 has been blocked on owner-authored briefs since
       2026-08-23 and the loop cannot unblock it by design. Holding a page that
       pays on its own behind a gate only the owner can open trades a certain
       benefit for a possible second authoring pass. Decoupled: build it now,
       and accept that a later contract layer might touch it again.

       It is now **the only dispatchable build item in the backlog** — every
       other open item waits on the owner or on an unmet condition.

       **Shipped at `/concepts/which-pattern`**, under concepts rather than
       patterns: it documents no screen, so the pattern-shape gate rightly
       does not apply to it.

       Every cell is read from `patterns.json` — the same file that builds the
       tile index and the sidebar — so adding a pattern adds a row with no
       edit here, and rewording an opener rewords its row. Three things are
       extracted, because they are the three a reader chooses by: the job
       family, who the screen is for, and **the pattern's own statement of
       when it is the wrong choice**. That last is the most useful column and
       the most reliable source, because `check:wrong-choice` requires every
       page to carry the clause.

       Verified against the numbers measured BEFORE building, which is the
       independent check: **39 rows across 6 groups, 39 pattern links, and 17
       alternative links** — the clauses that name another pattern outright
       get a real link to it. Five rows show a dash, and the page says so in
       its own words rather than hiding it: a blank means the clause is
       phrased in a way the extraction did not match, never that the page is
       silent on it. Where a clause describes an alternative instead of naming
       it, the prose stands — inventing a link the author did not write would
       be the page guessing.

**REFUSED, with reasons (recorded per the grill's Q6 — re-open any of
these when a second real consumer of `@busy-office/ui` exists):**
- **Consumer Quality Index /100 + application benchmarking** —
  organizational-governance machinery for teams that don't exist yet;
  fails the proposal's own §16 demonstrated-gap rule. The anti-gaming
  design (§24 medians/percentiles) is good and is preserved here for
  the re-proposal.
- **Waiver system (PASS WITH WAIVERS, expiry, SARIF output)** — CI
  exception machinery for human orgs; an AI agent needs PASS/FAIL and
  readable findings, nothing more.
- **A second Surface Fitness rubric (proposal §13, 5-dim /15)** — the
  six-dimension DSA rubric already exists and is gated; running two
  violates the proposal's own §2.6. Its one real improvement — the
  Removal Cost axis + fitness×cost decision matrix (§15) — may be
  absorbed into the existing rubric as a future Standardize item.
- **The six-section docs IA reorg (§3)** — ~80% renames groups that
  were each measured into place more recently than the proposal was
  written (2026-08-16 comparative IA pass; 104.1's single-source
  grouping). Extracted instead: 112.5, and possibly an Integration
  sidebar group as a future small item.
- **Hand-authored pattern metadata YAML (§30)** — inverts the
  generated-from-artifact doctrine; superseded by 112.1's extraction.
- **A consumer-facing conformance web tool (§34)** — downstream of a
  Quality Index that is itself refused.

## STATE — no dispatchable work; two owner calls (2026-08-18)

From the Slice 28 grill: `.roundtable/grill-objective-slice28-2026-08-18.md`.

**Every unchecked item in this file is undispatchable.** Three are NEEDS-RUNTIME
on owner hardware (VoiceOver, NVDA, AT runtime evidence); the fourth (Turbo) is
a conditional that has not fired. There is also no 1.0 definition anywhere in
the plan.

*(True on 2026-08-18, not now — 168.1 and 169.3 are both open and dispatchable.
Read the `N. [ ]` checkboxes, not this line. Noted 2026-08-28, Slice 170.1.)*

That is structural, not a lull: from here the dispatcher can only reach
Standardize, Objective and Explore — all of which generate work *about the
project*. It will keep producing self-referential improvement indefinitely and
look healthy doing it, because each piece of that work is genuinely good. The
Objective charter is a **filter, not a direction**: simplicity / less-for-more /
reusability say what to refuse, never what to build. Choosing a direction is
structurally an owner call, not something a loop can derive.

1. [x] **OWNER CALL — 0.2.0 release. ANSWERED 2026-08-21: owner triggered the
       publish, and it was cut as 0.3.0, not 0.2.0.** The tarball built at HEAD
       was labelled 0.2.0 but carried 304 commits of post-tag work (tabs,
       anchor-nav, context-menu, sticky-cols), so that number would have
       permanently described contents it did not have. 0.2.0 stays an accurate
       record of what was cut on 2026-08-18, annotated "tagged, never
       published"; the registry goes 0.1.1 → 0.3.0 and consumers get both
       sections' 83 entries, which the CHANGELOG now says outright. Tagged
       `v0.3.0` at `24c6e7d`, every gate green at 0.3.0. **Still not on the
       registry** — publishing runs through Trusted Publishing (OIDC), so it
       needs the owner to push the tag and publish a GitHub Release; tracked in
       `RESUME.md`, not here.

       Original text, kept for the record: **64 unreleased CHANGELOG entries**
       against a published **0.1.1** (`npm view` confirms). Slices 24-28 —
       query tokens, staging, mass change, four placeholder-only accessible
       names, the 1.46:1 search contrast, icons vanishing in print, the
       nav-label spill — are shipped, gated, and in nobody's `node_modules`.
       `npm install @busy-office/ui` today still gets the accessibility defects
       fixed two days ago. This is the previous grill's F5 one level up: the
       stale *site* was fixed, the stale *package* was not. Publishing is
       owner-triggered by policy; the work itself is done.

2. [x] **OWNER CALL — DECIDED 2026-08-26: (a) adoption/DX.** See Slice 147. Original text kept below.

2b. [x] **OWNER CALL — direction. REALIGNED 2026-08-24: the release blocker is
       GONE; this waits on a decision only.** It said the release "is cut as
       0.3.0 and awaits only the owner's push". **0.5.0 is published on npm** —
       checked, not assumed. The precondition was not merely met, it has been
       overtaken twice, and the recommended default below still says "ship
       0.2.0 first", which shipped long ago.

       Nothing structural blocks this any more. What remains is the choice,
       which was always an owner call: pick (a), (b), (c) or (d) below, or say
       "keep waiting for adopter feedback" and mean it as a decision rather
       than as a precondition.

       Recommended default (kept for its reasoning, though its ship-first
       clause is spent): **choose from real adopter feedback rather than from
       this room** —
       the cost being that feedback takes time, against the alternative risk of
       building the next twelve components for nobody. Candidates if the owner
       prefers to choose now: (a) adoption/DX — starter template, copy-paste
       screen kit, migration note; (b) depth on data maintenance — M2
       master-detail and M4 Excel round-trip are only partly done; (c) the
       autosave decision below, the one genuine product question already in the
       plan; (d) define 1.0 and close the gap to it.

**RETIRED — F1 (verification-to-product ratio).** The previous grill deferred it
with the trigger "revisit if the next window pushes past ~30:1". It fired:
framework CSS grew **+25 lines across 45 commits, and zero in two of three
15-commit windows**, so the denominator is zero and the ratio is meaningless.
The honest conclusion is that the **metric was wrong**, not that things are 30x
worse — zero CSS growth is the charter working, and a ratio that reads "added no
CSS" as failure would push toward adding CSS for its own sake. What it was
gesturing at is captured properly by the two owner calls above. Not to be
re-raised as a new finding.

11. [x] **Generated ACR** (Ines). VPAT-2.5-shaped page: WCAG 2.2 AA criterion
       × component, verdicts Supports / Conditional-on-adopter / Not
       Evaluated, generated from api.json + contrast.json + behaviors.json +
       the guarantees split. Accept: page generated, gated, linked from the
       accessibility concept; Not-Evaluated rows cite the AT gate.
12. [ ] **AT runtime evidence** — NEEDS-RUNTIME (owner hardware): combobox
       activedescendant, data-grid implicit roles, selection live-region on
       VoiceOver + NVDA; results recorded in `.roundtable/` and cited by the
       ACR. **Realigned 2026-08-24: unchanged, and genuinely unblockable by
       the loop** — it needs a human listening to a screen reader, which no
       gate here can simulate. `test:axe` (121 pages x 2 widths) and
       `check:forced-colors` cover what automation can; the residue is
       announcement behaviour, which only ears verify. Stays open rather than
       quietly closed, because the ACR cites it.
